My latest side-project is finally ready to go live. Introducing...

[![Let's Get Creative](https://bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative/banner-og.png)](https://bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative)

[**Let's Get Creative**](https://bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative) is a collection of high-quality, free, online, creativity tools. The website is intended to be a safe, bookmarkable, creativity resource for kids and adults.

## A little background

When the pandemic hit, we found ourselves with three bored school-aged kids at home. We were desperate to find productive-ish things they could do on their school Chromebooks without a lot of supervision. I started collecting links to creativity tools and [I published a list on this blog back in March 2020]({{site.url}}/2020/03/25/online-tools-for-creative-kids/).

The kids went back to school of course but I couldn't stop thinking about creativity tools. I [wrote about them]({{site.url}}/2023/03/17/theres-a-lot-to-like-about-the-web-share-api/) [a lot]({{site.url}}/2019/12/07/using-the-url-to-build-database-free-web-apps/) and I kept collecting links whenever I came across them (often [sharing them in]({{site.url}}/2022/04/28/links-5/) [my links posts]({{site.url}}/2023/05/11/links-7/)).

I'm not sure why I like them so much. I think they just live at the intersection of a lot of my interests. They use cool front-end web technologies. They encourage [exploration and experimentation]({{site.url}}/2019/03/28/the-unique-power-of-games-in-building-intuition/). They [give you superpowers]({{site.url}}/2018/02/18/the-cure-for-boredom-is-superpowers/) and an opportunity to [exercise your agency](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency). In a world of streaming services and [bed-rotting](https://www.health.com/what-is-bed-rotting-trend-7561395), I've developed a strong belief that [the future belongs to creators](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-future-belongs-to-creators/id1506329209):

Anyways, throughout this process I've become something of a creativity tools snob. The ones on Lets Get Creative are among the best, so I thought that building a nice site to feature them would be a valuable contribution to the internet.

## In which I got carried away building the site

The idea for this site started out simple but quickly became much more ambitious. Sure, a single HTML file would work but I felt like the projects deserved a proper showcase, with a design that truly captured their creative essence. I started to dream up interactive features and before I knew it I was knee deep in JavaScript frameworks, fighting build errors and wrangling 3rd party libraries.

My motivation tanked. Weeks went by with me staring into the abyss. Eventually, I asked myself, *"Why am I not excited to work on this anymore?"*

I found my answer. I had been building out this ambitious interactive header carousel thing but something was wrong. What was it? Was the feature a distraction? Was it tacky? Was it not worth the complexity? Whatever it was, my gut didn't like it and just I couldn't move forward. I ended up tearing out that code, trying something a bit simpler, and the motivation came roaring back. I learned a valuable lesson: sometimes your lack of motivation is trying to tell you something.

But I digress. The site finally feels right, so we're going live even though the code is still a mess. I aspire to tidy it up some more post-launch. ðŸ˜…

## Contribute

One of the goals of this project was to make it easy for anyone to contribute their own creativity tools. If you have a tool you'd like to share, there's a nice [CONTRIBUTING doc](https://github.com/bryanbraun/lets-get-creative/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-a-creativity-tool) that shows you what to do (it's really just editing [this one JSON file](https://github.com/bryanbraun/lets-get-creative/blob/main/public/creativity-tools/data.json)).

Besides that, you can also help me clean up my code if you want. Just check out the [open issues](https://github.com/bryanbraun/lets-get-creative/issues).

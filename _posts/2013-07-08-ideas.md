There's nothing more fun than coming up with interesting ideas. Letting you thoughts run away with them. Imagining all sorts of glorious outcomes. It's a real pleasure.

Most of these ideas die on paper, never coming to fruition. Some would say that's tragic, but I think it's ok. You have finite time and resources, and not all ideas are good.

If you have a really good idea though, one that captures your imagination and gets you excited, clear your deck, allocate your time, prepare your resources, and run with it.

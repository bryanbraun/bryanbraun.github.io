* It encourages you to document it, which is great for future reference
* It forces you to turn thoughts into words, which helps you clarify your understanding
* It forces you to evaluate what you're doing with your time. If this isn't worth sharing, is it worth doing?
* It forces you to become familiar with <a href="{{site.url}}/2013/08/11/obstacles-to-sharing-your-work">the channels available for online collaboration</a>. That means you know where to look if you want to leverage the work of others.
* It discourages sloppiness. I redesigned bryanbraun.com last week and I also <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/rebrauned">posted the Drupal theme publicly</a>. I've been wanting to do that for a while, but it took some some serious code clean-up for me to be comfortable releasing it. Now it will be a lot easier for me to update and maintain. It's certainly not perfect but it's a whole lot better (...aaaand responsive! Try it on your phone).
* You get to practice explaining things, giving demonstrations, even doing some marketing to some degree. All are great skills you should develop.
* It acts as a portfolio, which a clear picture to future employers and partners of the kinds of things that you like to do.
* It could benefit others and that feels good.

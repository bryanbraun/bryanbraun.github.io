I often hear about how important it is to live in the present. I agree, it's important.

But living in the moment today doesn't have to happen at the expense of tomorrow. And sometimes, the quick and temporary rush of endorphins today can have a high cost.

Things are temporary. Memories last forever.

Fear is temporary. <a href="{{site.url}}/2013/07/12/which-is-worse" title="Which is worse, fear or regret?">Regret</a> lasts forever.

Selfishness breeds temporary gain, while the friendships that come from selflessness can last forever.

When defining your underlying principles on how you make decisions with regards to money, opportunities, friends, and family, choose forever over temporary.

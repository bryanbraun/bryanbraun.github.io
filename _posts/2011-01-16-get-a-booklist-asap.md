title: "Get a Booklist ASAP!"

When I started at BYU, I was given a packet for all engineering undergraduates. Inside there was a booklist. These weren't required reading... in fact, they were for recreational reading. My professors knew something that I didn't: There is something about reading the right book that just lights your fire. It is incredibly motivating.

Think about it. Lets compare interest in the space shuttle (reminder: the vehicle we use to put man into space) to interest in Harry Potter.

Google search results:

Space shuttle: About 6,420,000 results  
Harry Potter: About 125,000,000 results

That is 125 Billion results. With a "B". There are probably even more by now. Like I said, the right book can really light your fire.

Good books are awesome. They can open your mind, twist your perspective, and get you thinking. The right book at the right time can inspire you and move you to action. It can change your life.

That's why I like to keep a running booklist. Mine started with the Engineering books, followed by recommendations from a finance teacher. I got more from the teacher of my entrepreneurship class, others from some guest lecturers, and the list goes on. Now I've made it a habit that when I visit with inspiring or influential people I ask them what books they recommend I read. They always have some good ones. In fact, I've never once had a response where the person says "I hate reading" or "I don't really read many books." Interesting correlation, huh?

After all, Emmerson said: "I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me." I read while I eat breakfast, so I get to check both boxes at the same time.

You can start your book list today and it only takes 15 seconds. Try this experiment. Go on <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Facebook">facebook</a> and for your status, ask the question: What are some good books to read?

Just do it and see what happens!

Then write them all down. It doesn't matter if it is fiction or non-fiction. You could also get some ideas from the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="New York Times Bestsellers">New York Times Bestsellers list</a>, the <a href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/05/14/100-must-read-books-the-essential-mans-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Essential Man's Library">Essential Man's Library</a>, or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/books" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="amazon.com bestsellers">the amazon.com bestsellers list</a>. Start today! You never know how it will affect you, and life is too short to put it off 'till later. Once you get started, you won't be the same again.

And that's a good thing.

Because if you don't, it impacts everything.

It impacts your energy, your patience, your engagement, and the quality of your work. It's a real bummer when you work so hard to prepare yourself to operate at a high level and then blow the opportunity by staying up too late.

It may seem like those couple extra hours may help win the battle but over time, you'll lose the war.

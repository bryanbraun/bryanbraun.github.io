I wrote this rather boring email in response to a [rather troubling FCC proposal][1] threatening Net Neutrality. You have likely heard something about this, and I won't go to the trouble to try and explain it clearly. Others have done that much better than I could... this is the best explanation I could find:

(you may also enjoy [this one][2], if late-night comedy is more your thing)

I don't usually write these kinds of letters. I typically stay away from online petitions, and I certainly have never emailed the FCC. But I've done my research, and this one's bad.

Classifying ISPs as common carriers is supported by [online activists][3], [startups][4], [investors][5], [big internet companies][6], and even [the inventor of the World Wide Web][7] himself. Anybody who cares about the long term value of the internet is in opposition to this proposal. Unfortunately, the proposal already passed. 

The only remaining hope is that public pressure turns the tables during the 120 day period of public comment (which has already started).

I encourage you to study the issue and [submit your comments][8] now, before it is too late.

<small>PS: You can read the public comments <a href="http://apps.fcc.gov/ecfs/comment_search/execute?proceeding=14-28">here</a>. They are quite interesting.</small>

<small>PPS: Don't waste your time signing online petitions... you're probably just going to end up on someone's email list. Instead, <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/comments">contact the FCC</a> and <a href="http://act.freepress.net/call/internet_congress_nn/">your representatives</a>.</small>

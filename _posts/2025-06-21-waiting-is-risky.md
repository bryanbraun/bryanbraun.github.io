I'm a note-taker and a list-maker. I have lists of books I want to read and movies I want to watch, but most of my lists are for collecting ideas. They include ideas for blog posts, websites, businesses, open-source code, video games, books, and other kinds of projects.

Some of these ideas, the really good ones, have been gestating for years. I find myself returning to them often to add details as I think of them, continually fleshing them out, and refining them. Some have pages of notes by this point. I tell myself that when the time is right for a new post, project, business or book, I can pick up the idea and run with it.

Sometimes it works pretty well. Both [Gridmaster]({{site.url}}/2020/09/08/gridmaster-closing-thoughts) and [Music Box Fun](https://musicbox.fun) were long-gestating project ideas that I built and launched when the time was right.

But I've also learned that waiting for the right time is risky.

For one, sometimes **the world changes**, and your idea no longer makes sense.

I once drafted a blog post about some quirky behaviors in `npm`, but by the time I came back to refine it, the behaviors had been fixed. Another time, I had an idea for a podcast, only [to watch somebody else create it]({{site.url}}/2014/02/14/tldr/) (they did a *great* job). Most recently, I've found that several of my project ideas can be replaced by a simple AI prompt (like, *"Generate some lorem ipsum text in the style of Dr. Seuss"*).

But the other reason that waiting is risky, is that **you change**.

I've got several ideas for children's books, but I can feel my interest in them waning as my kids get older. Several of the business ideas I added grew out of pain points that I no longer have. And when I look at some of the more ambitious projects, I wonder if I even still have the appetite to take a swing at them.

Maybe it's good that I didn't waste my time building some niche thing only to have it replaced by AI. Maybe I dodged a bullet by not committing to a business I would have grown out of.

But when I look at my freshest, most exciting ideasâ€”it pains me to know that if I don't build them now, I might never do it, because I'll never feel as passionate about them as I do today.

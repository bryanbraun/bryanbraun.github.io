When I was building [Checkboxland](https://www.bryanbraun.com/checkboxland/), I wanted to give it a plugin architecture. I felt like it was the best way to prevent it from eventually turning into a mega library with image decoding, drawing features, and all sorts of other stuff I'd have to maintain.

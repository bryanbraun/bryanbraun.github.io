I like a lot of things... like Tetris, Newspapers, BYU Football, Ultimate Frisbee, and Jimmy Eat World.

I also like statistics. A lot.

You probably already knew this, given the high number of stats related posts I've written (including the ones with [infographics][1], [internet statistics][2], [mobile phone statistics][3], <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2010/12/27/the-dvorak-keyboard-should-i-learn-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Dvorak Keyboard: Should I learn it?">Dvorak typing graphs</a> and images depicting [the size of the universe][4]).

By statistics, I'm not referring to the technical discipline. Sure, I had some good times in STAT 221, finding the standard deviation of data sets (if you're hardcore, you do it by hand... none of this calculator business). But honestly, I prefer skipping the work and diving into the results of other people's efforts instead. Given the right data, presented in the right way, I eat up their statistics like popcorn. Here are some of my favorite examples:

### 1. <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendwheel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Friend Wheel">Friend Wheel</a>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2011/10/09/i-like-statistics/facebook-friend-wheel/" rel="attachment wp-att-742"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-742" height="500" src="/assets/images/facebook-friend-wheel.jpg" title="facebook-friend-wheel" width="500" /></a>
</p>

I'm usually way skeptical about facebook apps but I'll be the first to admit that <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendwheel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Friend Wheel">Friend Wheel</a> is pretty cool. I like it because it's simple: all your facebook friends are arranged into a wheel. Then, a line connects any people within that wheel that are friends. The result: a kaleidoscopic arrangement of lines that brings insights about the structure of your group of friends.

### 2. <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/upload/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Stats of the Union">Stats of the Union</a>

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

This is a free (as in $0.00) Ipad app that graphically shows you health related data for anyplace in the United States. You can see everything from population data to incidence of colon cancer by county. It's quite revealing. Take a look at <a href="http://vimeo.com/23482967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Stats of the Union Video">their video</a> to get a taste of everything you can do with this app.

### 3. <a href="http://www.google.com/trends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Google Trends">Google Trends</a>

Here you can compare different search terms to see what terms are searched more often than others. It creates a line graph that turns out to be an indirect measure of popularity. Check out <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=picasa%2C+flickr%2C+smugmug%2C+iphoto&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Google Trends: Flikr, Picasa, Iphoto, and SmugMug">this comparison</a> of four popular photo management services:

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2011/10/09/i-like-statistics/google-trends-photo-services/" rel="attachment wp-att-743"><img alt="Flickr vs Picasa vs iphoto vs Smugmug" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-743" height="293" src="/assets/images/Google-Trends-Photo-Services.jpg" title="Google-Trends-Photo-Services" width="592" /></a>
</p>

Playing around on Google trends can be a lot of fun. I recommend that you try other comparisons like <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=myspace%2C+facebook&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Google Trends: Myspace vs Facebook">myspace vs facebook</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=firefox%2C+internet+explorer%2C+chrome&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Google Trends: Firefox vs Internet Explorer vs Chrome">firefox vs internet explorer vs chrome</a>, or <a href="http://www.google.com/trends?q=BYU%2C+University+of+Utah&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all&sort=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Google Trends: BYU vs University of Utah">BYU vs University of Utah</a> (I especially like that one).

### 4. <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Gapminder">Gapminder</a>

This website is basically Hans Rosling's statistics playground. It has a huge interactive graph that lets you compare any two data sets, for all countries in the world, over the last several hundred years. Then you can press "play" and watch the graphs dance around as the years move by.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.socialearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Gapminder-World.jpg"><img alt="" class="alignnone" height="300" src="http://www.socialearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Gapminder-World.jpg" title="Gapminder Graphs" width="490" /></a>
</p>

No attempt for me to describe it can do it justice. Just go <a href="http://www.gapminder.org/world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Interactive Gapminder Map">check it out</a>. If you can't get enough of Hans and his amazing stats, then watch his slick documentary, "<a href="http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-joy-of-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Joy of Stats">The Joy of Stats</a>".

### 5. Religion Stats on Wikipedia

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/North_America_percent_LDS_2007.PNG"><img alt="" class="alignnone" height="533" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/North_America_percent_LDS_2007.PNG" title="LDS Membership Statistics in North America" width="619" /></a>
</p>

If you research different religions on Wikipedia, you'll soon realize that you can find some really interesting membership and geolocation statistics for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Religious_demographics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Religious Demographics">many major religions</a>, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Demographics of Atheism">atheism</a>. Consider looking at these:

* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism_by_country" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Catholicism Membership Data">Catholic Membership Data</a>
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Muslim_population" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Islamic Membership Data">Islamic Membership Data</a>
* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints_membership_statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Membership Data">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Membership Data</a>

### 6. <a href="http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Information is Beautiful">Information is Beautiful</a>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  This is a neat little site that has a lot of slick infographics. Like what? Like this: <a href="http://infobeautiful2.s3.amazonaws.com/leftright_EU_1416.gif"><img alt="" class="alignnone" src="http://infobeautiful2.s3.amazonaws.com/leftright_EU_1416.gif" style="width: 770px; height: 556px;" title="Left vs Right" /></a>
</p>

You can have a lot of fun (and eat up a lot of time), just browsing through this and other infograpics available at the site.

### 6. Browser Statistics

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2011/10/09/i-like-statistics/w3-browser-statistics/" rel="attachment wp-att-744"><img alt="W3 Browser Statistics" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-744" height="247" src="/assets/images/W3-Browser-Statistics.jpg" title="W3 Browser Statistics" width="641" /></a>
</p>

Does it really matter which web browser everybody uses. Probably not. But it's kind of fun to see the ebb and flow of browsers as some sort of indicator for the popularity of the company that built it (Microsoft, Apple, Google, etc). My favorite source for this data is <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="W3 Browser Stats">W3's Browser Statistics</a> (though there's also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Wikipedia Browser Statistics">a lot of info on Wikipedia</a> as well).

### 7. Public Information

Last but not least is the wealth of public data collected by governments and independent researchers all over the world. Most of the time, they <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMDqP0oy7_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="2010 Census: A Difficult Process">work their buns off</a> to get this data and then they just throw this stuff up on the internet for the public (aka "me") benefit. They've got everything from data sheets to reports to interactive maps. I love it. Here are the goods:

* <a href="http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The 2010 US Census">The 2010 US Census</a>
* <a href="https://www.prb.org/Publications/Datasheets/2011/world-population-data-sheet/#/map/population" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The World Population Data Sheet">The World Population Data Sheet</a>
* <a href="http://people-press.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Pew Research Center">The Pew Research Center</a>

So you can call me crazy if you like but I love this kind of stuff. And don't hold out on me! Tell me if I'm missing any great websites on this list. It's all about sharing the wealth.

Having an contrary opinion makes me feel smart and important.

I haven't tried to see the situation from another person's perspective.

I speak before I think.

I'm not deliberate about identifying and celebrating the positivesÂ 

I can't muster the emotional strength to fight the tendency

I feel helpless about my situation and I don't know what else to do about it.

It's the path of least resistance.

On April 14th 2013 I had an idea, and I thought it was pretty good. I'm kind of a podcast junkie and I wanted to start up a Podcast airing a series of stories about how the web is impacting the human experience. It would do for the web what [Radiolab][1] is doing for science. It would provide a representation of life in the connected age. It would be [The New Aesthetic][2] in audio form. I was pretty excited.

Of course, I had [several projects][3] on my plate at the time. Things got busy and the podcast went to the bottom of the list. You know how these things often go.

On September 17th WNYC launched [a new podcast called TLDR][4], "a weekly podcast featuring short, surprising stories about the internet".

At first I was crushed. Then I thought, you know, maybe this isn't what I had in mind. Maybe it'll be quirky and off-target. You know, an off-putting nerd-fest full of 4chan memes, sound effects, and internet subculture. Maybe it'll just fizzle out.

But I started listening to it and guys, it's awesome. SOOOOOOOO GOOD!

They're doing such a great job with it, that I've realized that I just have to let my idea go. They're doing everything with it that I ever dreamed to do (plus, they've got funds). Listen to it. Tell all your friends.

So go forth and conquer TLDR. Blow them out of the water.

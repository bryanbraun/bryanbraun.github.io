If you can **tolerate discomfort**, then you can camp much lighter. Camping lighter means you spend less time and energy packing, setting-up, tearing down, and unpacking. The same goes for travel. Fewer clothes and shoes means less luggage to carry, manage, and lose. You can board the plane in peace.

If you have **skills**, you can swim without needing a flotation device, goggles, or a nose plug. You can prepare your food with a single good knife, instead of a drawer-full of specialized cutting tools. You can secure anything with a rope and some knots. You can do more with less.

If you have **knowledge**, you can get around your city without needing a navigation device. You can speak other languages, reducing stress and confusion when you travel. You can move through the world with confidence.

If your body is **healthy**, you can walk long distances, carry heavy things, and recover quickly from life's little injuries without missing a beat. You don't need to deal with medication, monitors, or support equipment. You can handle whatever the situation requires.

Capability makes your life simpler. Tolerance, skills, knowledge, and health are always with you, wherever you go. They are assets but they take up no space. They are stored in your body.

Some lack capability through no fault of their own, but anyone can increase their capability. It's an investment that pays dividends every day.

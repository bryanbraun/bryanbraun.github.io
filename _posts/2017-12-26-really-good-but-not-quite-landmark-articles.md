One of my little projects that I haven't talked much about is a webpage called [Landmark Articles]({{site.url}}/landmark-articles/). It's a list of the ten online articles that have influenced me the most in my life/career as a web developer.

I update the list often, but it's always hard because I often read things that are really good, but not good enough to knock something else off the list.

So instead of just tossing these almost-good-enough ones aside, I figured I'd share a handful of them here. I hope you like them!

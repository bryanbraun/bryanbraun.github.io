  The modern world, with it's tsunami of information can be overwhelming. There are more people publishing more opinions about more topics then ever before. There are <a href="http://www.missminimalist.com/2010/09/minimalist-living-movement-or-fad/">counter-cultural movements</a> rising up to push back against the noise and embrace a zen-like way of life. It's a lot to digest. I won't belabor the point.

  So what about your voice? Should you even bother?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  You should! Life is rich and you have a special perspective. It will benefit you to tell your story, and it will benefit us to hear it. Not that you should talk for talking's sake. We don't need more emotional vomit or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">Lorum Ipsum</a>. Talk less, but say more. We need your best.

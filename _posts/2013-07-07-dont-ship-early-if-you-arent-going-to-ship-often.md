  The funny thing about "<a href="http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The topic has been discussed in a lot of ways, but this is a good overview post">ship early, ship often</a>"...

  …is that it doesn't work, if you don't ship often.

  Everybody starts out projects with the best of intentions, but life gets busy. You might not think that something else will call for your attention, but you can never predict what the future will bring.

  So yes, ship. <a href="http://www.busybuildingthings.com/products/real-artists-ship-print" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Real artists ship">Please ship</a>! But, if you are planning on shipping early, <a href="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/luke/14.28?lang=eng#27"><span class="s1">count the cost</span></a> and make sure your committed to shipping often. If you aren't committed to shipping often, then finish the job now. Do a clean launch and move on.

<p class="p1">
  There's a lot to be afraid of.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Every unfamiliar situation could bring threats. Every <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2012/02/26/be-bold" target="_blank" title="Be Bold">bold</a> choice could bring unintended consequences. With every major decision you make, you are inevitably restricting your future opportunities.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  So we shun the unfamiliar, become less bold, and put off major decisions. We talk more and do less. We surf more and make less. With each additional <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2011/02/27/fear-and-the-critical-moment" title="Fear and the Critical Moment">critical moment</a>, paralysis sets in.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  What you need to ask yourself is this. Which is worse: the pain of fear, or the pain of regret?

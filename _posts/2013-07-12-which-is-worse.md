There's a lot to be afraid of.

Every unfamiliar situation could bring threats. Every <a href="{{site.url}}/2012/02/26/be-bold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Be Bold">bold</a> choice could bring unintended consequences. With every major decision you make, you are inevitably restricting your future opportunities.

So we shun the unfamiliar, become less bold, and put off major decisions. We talk more and do less. We surf more and make less. With each additional <a href="{{site.url}}/2011/02/27/fear-and-the-critical-moment" title="Fear and the Critical Moment">critical moment</a>, paralysis sets in.

What you need to ask yourself is this. Which is worse: the pain of fear, or the pain of regret?

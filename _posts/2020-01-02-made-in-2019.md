There's a lot that I'm proud of here, but at the same time, I fell short of some milestones I was hoping to reach. It's easy to feel a bit disappointed, but I've been trying to remind myself of an idea [recently expressed by James Clear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1212459953195233280):

> Focus on your current trajectory, not your current results.

My trajectory in 2019 was good. As long as I keep that trajectory strong, then I know that, eventually, the results will come.

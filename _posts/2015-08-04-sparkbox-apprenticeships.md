I've been with Sparkbox for just over 4 months now. I've witnessed their apprenticeship program and it is unreal.

For 6 months you get paid to come into the Sparkbox space and learn modern web development. Unlike many internships out there, you aren't doing cleanup work for client projects or being burdened with repetitive QA tasks. *You'll spend all of your time focusing on your learning*, which is a mixture of self-directed work and guided practice.

You get to work with modern tools and use modern web development techniques. As an agency, we are redesigning sites and apps (and our processes) from the ground up every couple months. We don't have to get stuck working with legacy technology choices, and neither will you.

The mentoring opportunities are great. First, you get to learn from the super-talented Sparkbox designers & devs, who have this amazing combo of skill and down-to-earth'edness that you'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else. Then you get to participate in all the [meet-ups][1] and [events][2] we hold in the Sparkbox conference space, including [our Maker series][3] where you get to mix, mingle, and learn from industry leaders. You may even end up becoming a Sparkbox employee at the end (which, take it from me, is pretty awesome).

I wish that I had known about the Sparkbox apprenticeship when I was just starting out as a web developer. It is the best kept secret for web development in the Midwest. If you are interested in learning more, check out [the blog post kicking off applications for next year][4]. You can also [email me][5] with questions which I'll be happy to answer.

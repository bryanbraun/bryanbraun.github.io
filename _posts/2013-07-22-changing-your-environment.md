Instead of trying to change yourself (which is hard), just change your environment (which is easier).

[Freeze your credit card in a block of ice](https://www.sapling.com/5903043/freeze-credit-card-block-ice). Put your alarm clock on the other side of the room. Attend events and user groups for the people that you want to be more like. Follow those people online. Go to church. Be deliberate about the State and City and neighborhood you live in.

These things change your environment, which will indirectly change you, over time. You do the easy part and your circumstances do the hard part.Â This is a huge takeaway from ["Switch" (one of my favorite books)](https://www.bryanbraun.com/books/#switch-how-to-change-things-when-change-is-hard), and it's become one of my most valuable life-hacks.

You'll bike more often if you sell your car.

It's hard to go wrong in your web project if you err on the side of simplicity. That goes for both on the design side and development side.

You can't do everything at once, so don't. Build the essential parts and make them look really clean. It's easier to add more later than it is to take something away (if not for technical reasons, then for <a href="http://www.bryanbraun.com/2011/04/10/bryan-vs-the-sunk-cost-fallacy" title="Sunk costs strike again.">emotional reasons</a>).

It means less noise. Less distraction. Less delay in shipping your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product" title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</a>.

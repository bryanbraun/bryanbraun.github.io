<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn1mFnK97Hs">This London beatboxer</a>Â makes sounds that our ancestors would have considered humanly impossible. You could argue that such sounds actually were humanly impossible. After all, this kind of beatboxing came by imitating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep">dubstep</a> mixers that produced combinations of sounds that didn't exist 20 years ago. Would we have stretched ourselves this far without something to imitate?

Similarly barefoot skiing started when water-skiers kicked of their skis to see if they could stay upright without them. Now, they are doing tricks and jumps while skipping over the water at 40 miles per hour. Would there have been barefoot skiing if there weren't skis?

We taught the machines. And now they are teaching us.

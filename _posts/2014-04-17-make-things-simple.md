How simple?

Insultingly simple.

Sometimes when we're working on something complex, we feel like we don't want to dumb it down too much, because we don't want to be deprecating. Nobody wants to be treated like an idiot, right?

Right, but here's the rub. Making things simple doesn't make people feel like idiots. It makes them feel smart!

Have you ever put together a piece of IKEA furniture without even having to consult the instructions? That's an insultingly simple design. And it feels great.

Make your emails simple. Make your code simple. Make your logo simple. Make your documentation simple. Refactor your copy, just like you would your code.

Simplify, then simplify again.

Then simplify again.

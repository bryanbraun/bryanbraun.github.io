I really love the Google Zeitgeist videos for the spirit in which they reflect on each year (see the ones for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0QXB5pw2qE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Zeitgeist 2010: Year in Review">2010</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SAIEamakLoY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="This is my favorite one.">2011</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xY_MUB8adEQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Zeitgeist 2012: Year in Review">2012</a>). These are fantastic for looking back at the big events we all experienced throughout the year.  

I also like to put together an annual retrospective (see the ones for [2010][1] and [2011][2]) to consider the things my family and I have experienced and the ways that we have grown. Let's jump in.

2012 was amazing.

Our family grew by 33%, if you count number of people, or only by 3.5%, if you are counting biomass. We added 11,527 miles to our car and, collectively, we stepped foot in 1 Country, 1 Ocean, 8 airports and 23 [States][3]. Since last year, the number of [books][4] I read decreased by 58% but the number of blogs I subscribed to increased by 113%. I <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Bryan Braun on Twitter">tweeted</a> 176 times, posted 111 things on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bryanbr4un" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Bryan on Facebook">Facebook</a>, and built 5 websites [<a href="http://pjlove.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="pjlove.org">1</a>][<a href="http://writer.bryanbraun.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="writer.bryanbraun.com">2</a>][<a href="http://php.bryanbraun.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="php.bryanbraun.com">3</a>][<a href="http://chadneilsen.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="chadneilsen.com">4</a>][<a href="http://brendabraunart.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="brendabraunart.com">5</a>].

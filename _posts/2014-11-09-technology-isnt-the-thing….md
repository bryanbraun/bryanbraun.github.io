Javascript isn't the thing. Or Git. Or Docker. Or [insert buzzword here].

It's easy to talk technologies, get into the weeds, and obsess over them, but at the end of the day, they are just tools, and we are mechanics. It's fun to talk about tools, but let's face it, people don't care about Javascript. They care about seamless user experiences, finding exactly what they are looking for, connecting with people they care about, learning something new, and using applications that give them superpowers.

The world is a lot bigger place when we focus our energy towards the end goal, instead of the means.

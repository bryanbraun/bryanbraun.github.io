<p class="p1">
  A couple ways:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    Following developers online: Web developers like to talk about the tools they useâ€¦ all you have to do is listen. <a href="https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="You can start with me! :) But seriously, there are a lot of good lists and people on twitter that will keep your feed filled with good stuff.">Follow them</a> online. <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/bryanbraun" title="You can start with mine! :) But seriously, find people talking about this stuff and start listening in.">Subscribe</a> to their <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2011/web-browser-frontend-and-standards-feeds-to-follow/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="Here's a big batch of other good ones from Paul Irish.">blogs</a>. In fact, <a href="http://www.webappers.com/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="Webappers - Best Open Source Resources">some blogs</a> do nothing but open-source roundups.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    Word of mouth: Talk to open source people. Talk to them at meet ups, user groups, and conferences. Talk to them at work or over lunch. The more you talk, the more you'll hear the good resources come up again and again.
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    Experience: When I hear about this javascript framework, or that icon library, it tends to go in one ear and out the other. But nothing cements these tools in your brain like using one on a project. So try them out... even if it's just for a single landing page, or an isolated experiment.

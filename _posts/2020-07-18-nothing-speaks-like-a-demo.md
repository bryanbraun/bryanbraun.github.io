When I came back from [Recurse center](https://www.recurse.com/) with a working version of [Checkboxland]({{site.url}}/2020/06/06/checkboxland/), I was sure it was going to generate some interest when I shared it.

I was wrong. I shared it with peers, and posted about it on some social media and link-aggregation sites, but it basically went nowhere.

I didn't understand. "Don't they see what kinds of interesting possibilities this opens up?" *(spoiler: they didn't)*

It wasn't until months later, that I thought, *"whatever, I'm just gonna use Checkboxland to build a bunch of [cool](https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1264014217063149569) [demos](https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1275646509200146434)".* Shortly after that, it was featured in a bunch of [newsletters](https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily/status/1276999499316166656) and [blogs](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/07/10/the-overflow-29-checkboxland/).

It reminds me of [Bret Victor](https://twitter.com/worrydream). Lots of people talk about the future of programming or the future of education. The thing that made Bret different is that [he](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/) [demoed](https://vimeo.com/36579366) [it](http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/). It didn't matter that his demos weren't fully built, or available for anyone to use. We simply needed to see it, in order to understand.

Nothing speaks like a demo.

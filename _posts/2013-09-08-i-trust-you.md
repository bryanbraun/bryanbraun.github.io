<a href="http://www.russellheimlich.com/blog/grocery-shopping-with-a-scan-gun-at-giant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Cool information about their setup here.">Several Giant grocery stores use a system</a> where shoppers pick up a scan gun and scan their own items as they pull them off the shelves. When you go to check out, you simply scan the register, pay, and leave.

At first I thought, "oh man, somebody could really take advantage of that." Then I realized that they wouldn't. Then I thought, oh man, that's brilliant.

Something interesting happens when you say to your customers "I trust you." They suddenly want to earn that trust. It turns a business transaction into a relationship.

Another example I saw this week was Chad Whitacre, founder of the quickly growing "[open company][1]" Gittip. He [deliberately puts his personal contact information in his Twitter bio][2], because he believes in being honest, transparent, and open with anybody he meets. It's definately a different approach in a day where [NSA whistleblowers][3]Â and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google#privacy" ttarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"title="Criticisms of Google">online advertisers</a> stir up online privacy converstations (and <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/area-man-outraged-his-private-information-being-co,32783/" ttarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"title="Area Man Outraged His Private Information Being Collected By Someone Other Than Advertisers">many great parodies</a>) daily.

It's special when you can be vulnerable and know that the other person will not hurt you. Distrust breeds contempt. Trust builds loyalty.

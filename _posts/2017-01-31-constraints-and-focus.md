In the summer of 2013 I decided that I wanted to write a blog post every day. I didn't want to sink tons of time into it, so I came up with a plan. Every morning on my way to work, I'd get on the Metro, pull out my laptop, and write my post during the 20 minute ride into Washington DC. Once I got to work, I'd publish it and start my day.

20 minutes is not a lot of time, especially for someone who tends to agonize over every sentence. It was a bit of a struggle, but I learned how to to keep my posts short, sweet, and potent.

When I look back at [my blog archives during that time](https://www.bryanbraun.com/archives/#y2013), I can't help but notice how many of my best posts were written on the subway that summer. Something about that 20 minute time-constraint gave me the focus to do my best work.

Constraints force you to focus on what's most important. That tends to produce good results, whether you're blogging, [writing software](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2015/02/09/on-project-constraints-and-immovable-deadlines/), [building a business](http://www.businessinsider.com/why-raising-too-much-money-can-harm-your-startup-2016-7), or working towards any important outcome.

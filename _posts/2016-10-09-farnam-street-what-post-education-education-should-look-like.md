I just wanted to share something quickly that I've been enjoying immensely.

For the last year or so, I've subscribed to a newsletter/RSS feed for a blog called [Farnam Street][1], which I found via a recommendation.

It's fantastic. I'm a huge proponent of [self-directed][2], [continual][3], [informal][4] education, and Farnam Street is what post-education education should look like. Farnam Street is to me, what Sesame Street is to my preschool-aged kids.

Its main premise can be summarized like this:

* The best way to set yourself up for good future outcomes is knowing how to make better decisions.
* The best way to make better decisions is to understand the world as it really is.
* The best way to understand the world as it really is, is to build [correct mental models][5] that help you see the forces that shape everything.
* The best way to [build mental models][6] is to learn from wise people and read [wise books][7].

Wisdom is a long-term pursuit that requires regular thoughtful investments and produces tangible benefits. Ignore [the news wasteland][8] and the election dumpster fire. It's all empty calories. There's more nutritional food-for-thought out there.

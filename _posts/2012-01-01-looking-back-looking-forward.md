The transition to a new year brings the opportunity for me to reflect back a bit on the past 12 months of my life.

### Looking Back

Last year was permeated with several achievements, few of which I can take credit for. Among these are:

*   <a href="http://windermeremarathon.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Running a Marathon in Spokane</a> with my three brothers
*   <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150305861357310&set=a.109463602309.93299.38085092309&type=3&theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Building the Muse sign</a>, outside Muse Music Cafe
*   Creating several websites, including <a href="http://upsideprovo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upsideprovo.com</a>, <a href="http://musemusiccafe.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">musemusiccafe.com</a>, <a href="http://justinhyatt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">justinhyatt.com</a>, and <a href="http://chadneilsen.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chadneilsen.com</a>, with a redesign and site-migration of <a href="http://bryanbraun.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Now with drupal power!">bryanbraun.com</a>.
*   My first stake calling (a position for serving in the LDS church)
*   One full year of weekly blog posts
*   <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2011/02/14/heidi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Becoming a father</a>
*   Landing a new position at the BYU MTC with responsibilities in software testing and IT governance
*   Declaring a business minor at BYU

Looking back over the year, I also tend to see which of my vices have flared up, and where I am failing in my duties and responsibilities.Â  I'm using this information to help plan my goals for the next year.

### Looking Forward

I've always enjoyed setting goals with the coming of each year. I've done this consistently since 2007, and the reason I keep doing it is because I've seen them have an impact on my life. In setting goals for 2012, I've decided to focus on three main points:

1.  Smile more
2.  Daily scripture study
3.  Be selfless

I want to emphasize something with these goals: I'm focusing these goals on **who I am, not what I do**. Why? Because I want to make goals that matter, and I believe that what really matters is who you are... not what you do. Let me explain.

When I left Africa in 2008, my mission president urged me to make a mission statement that defined who I was and what principles I wanted to guide my life. I spent weeks on it. I felt like I was taking a lifetime of personal experiences, bitter trials, and lessons learned from myself and others and condensing them down into half a page of text. It was incredibly difficult. When it was done however, it said nothing about what I intended **to do** in life (with one notable exception, being, to marry and have a family). It doesn't mention a specific career. It doesn't mention where I was going to live, what I was going to drive, or what hobbies I was going to pursue.

Those things don't matter. I don't care if I end up as a musician, a pilot, or a fisherman, and neither should anyone else. What should matter is who I have become. Do I care about other people, or myself? Do I run from my fears, or do I challenge them? What sort of influence do I have on others who spend time with me? Personality traits like cheerfulness, open-mindedness, spirituality, determination, and love aren't static. They diminish and grow as we ignore them or focus on developing them. That why I've selected these three things for my goals.

Of course, having a successful career, enjoyable hobbies, and a place to live are a big part of my life. This year I'll see several milestones in my academic and professional development, including:

*   Graduating from Brigham Young University with a BS in Mechanical Engineering, and a minor in Business Management
*   Graduating debt free (This is a miracle... you should have seen the look on my face when I first saw <a href="http://housing.byu.edu/offcampus/compdata/documents/FamilyHousing_000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the price of married housing in Provo</a>)
*   Pursuing a post education career path
*   Moving somewhere (if we're still around here in July they'll kick us out of campus housing)
*   Welcoming baby #2

Of course I'll be continuing to update this site so you can all stay posted on the big changes as they come. In the mean time, I wish you a healthy and prosperous 2012.

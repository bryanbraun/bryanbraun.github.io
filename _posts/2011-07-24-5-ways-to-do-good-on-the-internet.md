I'm as guilty as anybody is for wasting time online. Anyone who's spent an 3 hours on YouTube watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/realannoyingorange" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Real Annoying Orange">pointless videos</a> knows how quickly the internet can become the lazy man's playground. But you'd be wrong to believe that the internet is just a foul place to be avoided. In fact, some people have already found ways for the common web-surfer to do profound good, online. That's right, you can impact the world from the comfort of your own home (while listening to your favorite <a href="http://www.pandora.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Pandora">Pandora </a>station). For starters, here are 6 of my favorites:

## 1. Shop to Donate

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

If you do any of your shopping online, then try shopping through <a href="http://www.buy4.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="buy4.com">buy4.com</a>. There's a good chance that you'll be able to buy the same things at the same price, with 30% of the money going to your favorite cause. Learn more from this video.

Other sites like <a href="http://www.igive.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="iGive">iGive.com</a> and <a href="http://www.we-care.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="We Care: Shop for Charity">we-care.com</a> offer similar services that are worth checking out.

## 2. Click to Donate

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Click to Donate" src="/assets/images/Click-to-donate.jpg" title="Click-to-donate" />
</p>

Find a cause you like, click the button, and a third party donates money to the cause. If you think it's too good to be true, check out <a href="http://care2.com/click-to-donate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Click-to-donate">www.care2.com/click-to-donate</a>. You can click one time each day for a variety of causes. You don't even need to create an account or give anyone your personal information. It's that easy.

## 3. Search to Donate

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <img alt="Search to Donate" src="/assets/images/Search-to-donate.jpg" title="Search-to-donate" />
</p>

Now you can give to charity just by searching the internet (which you already do all the time anyways). At <a href="http://www.goodsearch.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="goodsearch.com">goodsearch.com</a>, you choose a charity and every time you run a search, they will donate money to that charity. While it doesn't trump Google in search result quality (can anyone?), from my test run it did just fine. What's more, if you use Firefox you can download <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/goodsearch-9674/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Goodsearch Firefox Add-on">this add-on</a> which adds goodsearch to your search bar in the top right corner of your browser.

## 4. Give a Microloan

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

<a href="http://www.kiva.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Kiva">Kiva.org</a> allows you to loan a small amount of money (starting at $25) to an entrepreneur in an underdeveloped country. It's a small amount of money, and with a repayment rate of nearly 99% you can rest assured that you'll get it back. Plus, the money goes straight to the people who have an idea, only lacking the money to get it started. I can't think of a more painless way to assist developing countries on such a personal level. Kiva's just plain cool (and <a href="http://www.kiva.org/about/stats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="kiva.org Statistics">their stats</a> are too). Read some bios of the people who are looking for funding at <a href="http://www.kiva.org/lend" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Kiva Entrepreneurs">www.kiva.org/lend</a>. I think you'll like what you see.

## 5. Volunteer a Talent

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

If you have a useful talent, you can volunteer to share it with non-profits with a tight budget. This is great for writers, designers, website builders, and pretty much any other service that can be outsourced. Websites like <a href="http://www.volunteermatch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="VolunteerMatch">VolunteerMatch</a> and <a href="http://www.smartvolunteer.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Smart Volunteer">Smart Volunteer</a> make it easy to connect talented professionals to the organizations in need. Pretty slick.

## 6. Play a Game

<p style="text-align: center;">

</p>

How do you donate food to UN World Food Program while sharpening your vocab at the same time? At <a href="http://www.freerice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Free Rice">freerice.com</a>, every quiz question you answer correctly donates 10 grains of rice. It's a fun way to test your knowledge in English, Math, Geography, Chemistry, or any other subject you choose. This and other socially considerate gaming sites (like <a href="http://doubleimpact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Double Impact">Double Impact</a> or <a href="http://www.gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Games for Change">Games for Change</a>) are really making helping others fun. &nbsp; So next time you catch yourself browsing YouTube for the next <a href="http://www.youtube.com/show/songifythis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Songify This!">Gregory Brothers song </a>think twice, and take a moment to <a href="http://www.care2.com/click-to-donate/rainforest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Save the Rainforest">click a button</a> or <a href="http://freerice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Free Rice">answer a vocab question</a>. That warm fuzzy feeling sure beats that feeling you get after a YouTube binge.

<small>And just a reminder (from my <a href="http://bryanbraun.com/2011/07/10/the-10-best-google-search-tricks/" title="The 10 best Google search tricks">Google Search Tricks post</a>), you can find more sites like these by doing a google search using the "related:" keyword (for example: "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=related%3Awww.igive.com&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Related Search: iGive">related:www.igive.com</a>"). Original idea from <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/07/07/social-good-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Mashable: Social Good Online">Mashable</a>. </small>

If you go to the DMV to get a driver's license in Virginia and attempt to smile for your photo, then they will ask you to stop smiling. If you ask why, they will tell you that it’s to assist the facial recognition software that may need to be used at some future date to match your face to your ID.

What a shame. We should be adapting software to meet human needs. Not the other way around.

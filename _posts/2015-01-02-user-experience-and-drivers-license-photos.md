If you go to the DMV to get a driver's license in Virginia and attempt to smile for your photo, then they will ask you to stop smiling. If you ask why, they will tell you that itâ€™s to assist the facial recognition software that may need to be used at some future date to match your face to your ID.

What a shame. We should be adapting software to meet human needs. Not the other way around.

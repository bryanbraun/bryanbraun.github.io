Sometimes when I step back from my miniature problems and reflect on the work I'm doing, I can't help but feel grateful. I really enjoy what I do.

I love being a web developer because there is so much opportunity.

The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a computer and an internet connection.

The knowledge is available. You can continually teach yourself skills through free resources and online communities.

Your reach is global. The things you make can be seen by people who live all over the world.

Your role models are accessible. Your In a single tweet or email, I can strike up a conversation with industry leaders at the top of my field, who typically put their contact information online.

Your required investment is low. Kicking off a project doesn't require any money for tools or materials. All you have to give is the time you would have spent watching TV.

Your pay is good. Especially compared to [the rest of the world][1].

Your work is magic: You transform 1's and 0's into human experiences like [finding a soulmate][2], [looking for a job][3], and [trying something new][4]. You are basically a modern day alchemist.

I think that's pretty hard to beat.

If you don't love what you do, then have a look at [this great post on the topic][5] by Paul Graham. He uncovers a lot of good thinking on the topic much better than I could.

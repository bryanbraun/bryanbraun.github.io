Suppose you spent 2 hours watching a movie. Even if the movie was free, there's a cost associated with losing that 2 hour block of time. If you could have spent that time working for $10 an hour, then the cost of that movie is $20. This "cost of other opportunities lost" is known to economists as an [opportunity cost][1].

If you look at the last 20 years of technologic advancement, you'd notice that this generation has been gifted with more tools to do incredible things, at a lower cost, than ever before. It used to be that if you wanted to put up a website, you needed to go hardware shopping. Now, with [AWS][2], you can rent a server in Singapore at the click of a button. Or heck, just pick a [Squarespace template][3] and drag-and-drop it together. If you have a good idea and a video camera, you can raise millions of dollars on [Kickstarter][4] and make it a reality. You can [start a club][5], [self-publish a book][6], [write a song][7], [learn a subject][8], or [make a movement][9]. What used to take connections and thousands of dollars, now just requires some time, internet access, and some [gumption][10].

Does that terrify you? It terrifies me.

That 2 hours is a lot more valuable today than it was 50 years ago. The relentless increase in opportunity costs is crushing.

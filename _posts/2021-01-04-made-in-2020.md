When the virus arrived early last year, bringing a wave of remote work, lock-downs, and layoffs, there were a lot of people who found themselves with more time on their hands.

I was not one of those people. My commute disappeared, but I had increasing responsibilities at work and church, not to mention homeschooling and house projects. Despite this, I was still able to build several things I was proud of last year.

Here's what I made in 2020:

- [Checkboxland]({{site.url}}/checkboxland/)
- A ["Git branching diagram" template](https://gist.github.com/bryanbraun/8c93e154a93a08794291df1fcdce6918)
- A conference talk ([How to build a zero-maintenance web application](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8VQQYrGaO0))
- Some Codepen animations ([Rainbounce](https://codepen.io/bryanbraun/pen/PoPyMyO), [Tile Town](https://codepen.io/bryanbraun/pen/gOaZgvJ), [Tri-stepper](https://codepen.io/bryanbraun/pen/zYveYaz), and [a WebGL Star](https://codepen.io/bryanbraun/pen/BazGwmb))
- An article, published on CSS Tricks ([Designing a JavaScript Plugin System](https://css-tricks.com/designing-a-javascript-plugin-system/))
- 26 blog posts [on bryanbraun.com]({{site.url}}/archives/#y2020) and [the Sparkbox blog](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/author/bryan_braun)
- 30+ music box songs (in the Song Library on [musicbox.fun](https://musicbox.fun/))

It was also a big year for me revisiting some old projects to release a new 2.0 version:

- [Twitter Timeline Eradicator (2.0)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-timeline-eradicat/olmgbkhifmcfpaagiaakihcgobdkmchl?hl=en-US)
  - I revived this defunct Chrome extension out of necessity because Twitter was a particularly gross place this year. Works like a charm.
- [Commit Colors (2.0)](https://github.com/sparkbox/commit-colors)
  - This became my first public Golang project. It's available via homebrew!
- [Your life](https://github.com/bryanbraun/your-life)Â (in [weeks]({{site.url}}/your-life/weeks.html), [months]({{site.url}}/your-life/months.html), and [years]({{site.url}}/your-life/years.html))
	- I first made these in 2016. The new updates really improved SEO and made them easier to use and navigate.

Checkboxes, color swatches, and music box songs. It was a year of following my interests and not caring too much about what would be popular or profitable.

No regrets. It just felt right. We'll see what feels right in 2021.

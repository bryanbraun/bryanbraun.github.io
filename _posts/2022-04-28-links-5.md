**[The Curse of Xanadu](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/)** - The bizarre story of the internet that never was. The article gripped me and I just couldn't stop reading. "Is this a true story?" "How have I never heard of this before?" This feels like one of those situations where the world could have turned out very differently. Also relevant: [Ted Nelson's response to the article](http://web.archive.org/web/20001101230424/http://www2.educ.ksu.edu/Faculty/McGrathD/Fall99/NelsonLtr.htm).

**[Mechanical Mirrors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV8v2GKC8WA)** - A video about a guy who builds clever mechanical displays. Somebody shared it after seeing my Checkboxland project and it blew me away. It's got that perfect blend of creativity + engineering + software that I love. Bonus link in a similar category: [Tides](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUTPlQzfz1k)

**[Javascript Function Composition: What's the Big Deal?](https://jrsinclair.com/articles/2022/javascript-function-composition-whats-the-big-deal/)** - James Sinclair walks through some experiments with JavaScript functions and inadvertently makes a fairly compelling case for functional programming. It ended up being the most approachable post on functional programming I've read.

**[Extreme Ironing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ironing)** - Just people ironing clothes in a variety of strange locations (while parachuting, in the middle of a street, underwater, etc). One for the random category.

**[Essays on programming I think about a lot](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/)** - A links list on my links list. Meta! By the time I found this list I had already read four or five of the essays, and those ones were great, so I knew the other ones had to be pretty good as well. If that's not enough, you can see my own "essays I think a lot about" list here: [Landmark Articles]({{site.url}}/landmark-articles/)

**[AI Generated Pokemon Sprites with GPT 2](https://matthewrayfield.com/articles/ai-generated-pokemon-sprites-with-gpt-2/)** - Matthew Rayfield documents his process generating 3000+ Pokemon character sprites using GPT-2. It's incredible how well some of these turned out. Again, it's got that irresistible mix of creativity, engineering, and fun (and nostalgia!) that I love. If you like this, [his other projects](https://matthewrayfield.com/projects/) are equally wonderful and weird.

**[Puzzlescript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/editor.html)** - Yet another clever, web-based, online game building environment (like [bitsy](http://ledoux.io/bitsy/editor.html), [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), and [pico-8-edu](https://www.pico-8-edu.com/)). I can't seem to get enough of these. This one is focused more on puzzle games.

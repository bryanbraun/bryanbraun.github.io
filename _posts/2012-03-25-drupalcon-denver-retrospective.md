So I decided to take a one week hiatus from school. Whoo hoo!

But rather than hitting the powdered slopes or taking a self-declared spring break in Vegas, we packed up the car and headed down to Denver.

Why?

Drupalcon!

Drupalcon is a bi-annual conference about <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Drupal.org">Drupal</a>, the open source Content Management System that is often used for building powerful websites. If you didn't notice that little credit at the bottom left corner of my site, then now you know that my newly redesigned site is built with Drupal. And so are sites for <a href="http://www.popsci.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="popsci.com">Popular Science</a>, <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="mittromney.com">Mitt Romney</a>, <a href="http://www.ncaa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="ncaa.com">the NCAA</a>, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="whitehouse.gov">the White House</a>, and many other organizations.

It just so happens that this Drupalcon was in Denver, and since I have family in Denver, taking a trip out there was somewhat of a no-brainer.

The event was great. It was kind of like school, but with more food, less stress, and lots of opportunities to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/BryanEBraun/status/182265184411328512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cool people</a>. During each lecture period I got to choose between at least 10 different <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Drupalcon Denver Schedule">concurrent events </a>I could attend (it was similar to the format for [BYU's education week][1]). The result is that there was always something going on that was interesting and valuable for me.

Over all, this was the first time I had been to an event like this, but I doubt it will be the last.

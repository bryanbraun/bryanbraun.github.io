There's some conflicting information out there about installing npm with homebrew, because the process has changed a couple times. For the time being, however, it's a cinch. Just open up the terminal and run the following commands.

```
# Install node.js. npm will be installed along with it.
brew install node

# Verify that npm is installed.
# If this command returns a filepath to npm, then it's there.
which npm
```

And you're done.

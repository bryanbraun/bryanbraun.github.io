</p>

<p class="p1">
  But in the hours I spent staring at the screen, I forged neural pathways in my brain that created strong associations between being in a state of quick, responsive focus, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whBg7IF5JUg" target="_blank" title="Listen to it. Isn't it fantastic?">the Tetris music</a>.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Now when my morning alarm plays that music, I experience a deeply engrained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" target="_blank" title="Ivan Pavlov hails from Russia, which is where Tetris originates as well. Coincidence?">Pavlovian response</a> where I immediately spring out of bed, analyze my surroundings, and move efficiently onto all the things I need to do that day. I'd also say that I experience an irrepressible urge to organize things, but that's stretching the truth a bit.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Now I'm looking for other Pavlovian responses I've unintentionally developed throughout my life that I can hack into other behaviors I want to encourage.

  I love life.

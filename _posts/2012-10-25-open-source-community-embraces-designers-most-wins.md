That's my theory. Here's my reasoning:

The nature of open source projects is that they are built out of the small contributions of hundreds and thousands of developers all over the world. Think about it. This is a logistical nightmare. You have thousands of people with thousands of opinions firing in all sorts of directions. It's a nightmare even if you have a strong governing body directing the work. Most software companies have leadership teams with the authority to guide projects, cut funding, lay off workers, add resources, negotiate scope, or determine priorities. With open source projects, the developers do all these tasks. It's amazing really. How do they do it?

They establish a process for contribution. Then they design and develop collaboration tools and contribution workflows that make the process possible. In these workflows, they put checks in place to ensure high quality, solid integration, and attention to security. For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Linux (Wikipedia)">Linux</a> project has developed a host of software tools including <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="LXR: The Linux Cross-Reference">LXR</a>, <a href="http://git-scm.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Git VCS">Git</a>, and their own <a href="http://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="kernal.org">Kernal.org</a> code repository to help manage the contribution effort. Other open source organizations like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> and <a href="http://www.drupal.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="drupal.org">Drupal</a> have since adopted many of these tools (like <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Mozilla MXR">here</a>, and <a href="http://dxr.mozilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Mozilla DXR">here</a>, and <a href="http://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal.git" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Git repository for the Drupal project">here</a>).

Unfortunately, when you have groups of developers building software for themselves, you wind up with open source contribution infrastructure that only fits the needs of developers. And good software (by today's standards) requires much more than developers. The best software, like <a href="http://basecamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Famously easy to use">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://www.photoshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Adobe's darling">Photoshop</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Inertial scrolling, baby.">iOS</a> is the result of collaborative efforts from several kinds of people with competing interests, including Graphic Designers, Interaction Designers, and Information Architects, to name a few. Can an open source project be successful if its contribution channels repel these kinds of people?

Maybe. Take a look at the open source success stories (we'll define "success" as projects that grew to acquire a huge marketshare in their industries). We've got <a href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="apache.org">Apache</a>, <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The worlds most popular open source database">MySQL</a>, and <a href="http://www.php.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="php.net">PHP</a>â€¦ all successes, but it's all software that isn't even seen by the mass markets. Exceptions exist, like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/fx/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="The Firefox Web Browser">Firefox</a>, but by and large, you could say that open source aimed at the mass markets has largely been a flop. Has [GNU/Linux][1] ever been a serious contender with <a href="http://www.apple.com/mac/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="Mac computers">Macs</a> and PCs? How has <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="openoffice.org">Open Office</a> (or <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="libreoffice.org">Libre Office</a>) fared against Microsoft Office? Have you even heard of <a href="http://inkscape.org/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> or <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="gimp.org">GIMP</a> or <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"itle="Mozillia has other products?">Thunderbird</a>? Those are the free alternatives for software that you currently pay for.

If you have tried to use any of this software, I think you'll quickly notice where the breakdown occurs. It's pure and simply, poor user experience. And when user experience is poor, it doesn't matter if your Photoshop wannabe can map a fractal trace using four different types of Mandelbrot parameters (and yes, it can). It doesn't matter if if costs $700 less than the commercial alternative (and yes, it does). You'll pick user experience over features any day of the week. And in order for open source to deliver a solid user experience, they'll need to do better at bringing designers on board.

(note: by just glancing at the websites of the projects I've mentioned, the lack of contributing designers is evident. Only one site really outshines these rest... <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="If you click the products tab, you'll see that all their products sites are amazingly designed.">Mozilla's</a>. I cannot speak for their contribution processes, but clearly, they got designers involved somewhere along the way. And with designers on board, is it any surprise that they were the ones that got mass market penetration? Not to me.)

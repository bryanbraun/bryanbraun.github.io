That's what I call the place I go to work on my projects without interruptions. It's not work. It's not home, it's my third place.

Having a third place means that I can focus on work at work, and I can actually be home when I'm home. It's better for everyone this way.

Right now it's the shared laundry room in my building. It's not exactly comfortable.  The light is on a thirty minute timer (which sounds annoying but is great for trying out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">the Pomodoro technique</a>). There's no chair or electrical outlet... just a counter I can set my laptop on that serves as a standing desk. It doesn't need to be comfortable. As long as I can pick up a wifi signal, it works for me.

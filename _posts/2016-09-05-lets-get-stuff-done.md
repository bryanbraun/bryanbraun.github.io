You have something you've been wanting to do for a long time.

Maybe it's that side-project that you really want to make progress on. It might be that book that you want to start writing, or some other idea you finally want to implement.

Or maybe it's a habit you want to start. A regiment of healthy eating and exercise, perhaps, or developing a new skill that takes time and effort.

You know you should be doing this. Maybe you've started a few times already but just haven't been able to make consistent progress. Things keep coming up, and you let yourself get distracted.

If this sounds familiar, then let's help each other, you and me.

Seriously. I'm in the same situation. I've got a project that I want to make progress on, but it just hasn't been happening.

So how about this. **What if you and I came together on a regular basis to hold each other accountable for making progress on our goals?**

I know this works. Setting up a system like this once helped me with [the best marathon training of my life][1]. This could be your chance to finally pull together the [gumption][2] to make that change you've been wanting for a while. It'll be a [Ulysses Contract][3] for you and I to *Get. Stuff.Â Done.*

<p class="p1">
  The words "style guide" can have a lot of meanings. If you're a writer, a style guide could define the language, tone, and principles you should use in a certain writing context. If you're a coder, it could define the preferred code structure, syntax, and commenting guidelines to be used on a certain project. Style guides exist in various professions when it's valuable to adopt a specific style of work, for a given situation. That applies to front-end developers too.
</p>

## Examples

<p class="p1">
  So what does a front-end style guide look like? Here are a couple examples.
</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">
  1. <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/downloads/markupguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mezzoblue Markupguide</a>
</h3>

<p class="p1">
  <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/downloads/markupguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/assets/images/mezzoblue-styleguide.png" style="float: right; height: 219px; width: 250px; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /></a>A simple example from Dave Shea (of CSS Zen Garden fame). He shows that you can start with something as simple as dropping a comprehensive batch of example markup on a normal page of your site.
</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">
  2. <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/about/styleguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paul Robert Lloyd's Styleguide</a>
</h3>

<p class="p1">
  <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/about/styleguide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/assets/images/paulrobertlloyd-styleguide.png" style="width: 250px; height: 230px; float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /></a>This one is similar to the first but it goes into more detail with the filler text, explaining what each of those elements are for. The result is both a style guide and a comprehensive HTML reference document. Pretty cool!
</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">
  3. <a href="http://pea.rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pears</a>
</h3>

<p class="p1">
  <a href="http://pea.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/assets/images/pears-styleguide.png" style="width: 250px; height: 208px; float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /></a>Pears documents the styles for <a href="https://github.com/simplebits/Pears" ttarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"<span class="s3">Dan Cederholm's Wordpress theme</span></a>. It goes beyond the common HTML elements by covering more complex patterns like breadcrumbs, tabbed navigation, and forms. For each pattern, it displays the element and also gives you the HTML and CSS it took to make that element.
</p>

<h3 style="clear: both;">
  4. The <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Github Style Guide</a>
</h3>

<p class="p1">
  <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/assets/images/github-clean-styleguide.png" style="width: 250px; height: 208px; float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /></a>Github's style guide is very detailed and comprehensive, covering everything from <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css/4.0" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"span class="s3">text styling</span></a> to <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/css/15.0" targtarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"an class="s3">alert messages</span></a>. Just by browsing around, you can see how documenting all this makes it easy for a new developer to join the team and start contributing work that is consistent with their current design paradigm. You can also click through the other tabs across the top to see other style guides, covering topics from their Ruby code, to the wording they use in their interface.

  Building your Front-end Style Guide
</h2>

<p class="p1">
  You probably don't have the time or budget to put together a dynamic front-end reference application (like <a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/aui/latest/sandbox/" ttarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"<span class="s3">this awesome one by Atlassian</span></a>), but you should still build a style guide. Just start simple. All you really need to do is write your CSS against a webpage containing the most common HTML elements. Doing this has a couple benefits:
</p>

<li class="p1">
  You ensure your design looks consistent and there are no gaps in your styling, no matter what content is being displayed.
</li>
<li class="p1">
  You can use it as a foundation for communicating and collaborating with other front-end developers.
</li>
<li class="p1">
  You'll end up with a simple document you can show stakeholders.
</li>

### Poor Man's Styleguide

<p class="p1">
  <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/frontend-styleguide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/assets/images/frontend-styleguide-template.png" style="width: 250px; height: 212px; float: right; margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" /></a>To help with this, I put together a <a href="http://github.com/bryanbraun/frontend-styleguide">Poor Man's Style Guide</a>, a style guide template that I'm finessing over time. It's dirt-simple and I recently put it <span class="s3"><a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun/frontend-styleguide" tatarget="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"p on Github</a></span>. I'll be using it as a base for new projects I work on, so feel free to copy it, fork it, or use it for your own projects as well.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Ultimately, building a front-end style guide is a great way to ensure that we are being consistent and not leaving gaps in our work. And with our work growing ever more complex, we need all the help we can get.

**[Picking better names for variables, functions, and projects](https://macwright.com/2021/02/17/the-naming-of-things.html)** - Tom MacWright shares some great, practical ideas for naming things as a developer. I like how he called out specific words to avoid like *data* and *setup*, which are often "correct" but too general to be useful. I also like this quote: "When you're writing code, just stare at *'what it does'* and *'what it’s called'* and make sure that they are the same thing."

**[Contribution and Abundance](https://dcurt.is/contribution-and-abundance)** - An extended quote from Ben Horowitz on sources of happiness. His description of abundance vs scarcity mindset feels spot-on to me. It's a topic that I've found myself thinking about a lot lately. There's a lot we can do to nudge ourselves towards happiness by strategically avoiding zero-sum games and framing our world in terms of abundance.

**[Hyperbolic Sokoban](https://sokyokuban.com/)** - A non-Euclidean puzzle game that you can play in your browser. I had a lot of fun figuring out how this strange environment worked. It reminded me to look up [Miegakure](https://miegakure.com/) again to see if it's been released yet (it hasn't).

**[A complete guide to useEffect](https://overreacted.io/a-complete-guide-to-useeffect/)** - When we got hooks in ReactJS, it made for cleaner and more functional code... but there were downsides. `useEffect` is React's alternative to the lifecycle api, but less intuitive and easier to mess up. This article by Dan Abramov walks exhaustively through common `useEffect` mistakes, identifying misconceptions, and using examples to explain how React works under the hood in each situation. It was a big help in getting me more comfortable in a React codebase that used hooks exclusively. I'm grateful the article exists, even if it's a bummer that it's necessary.

**[The world is much better; The world is awful; The world can be much better](https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better)** - Max Roser uses these three (true) statements as a lens through which we can look at human progress. History shows that it is possible to make the world a better place, and there are plenty of areas that we can still improve. It feels like a healthy way to look at the world.

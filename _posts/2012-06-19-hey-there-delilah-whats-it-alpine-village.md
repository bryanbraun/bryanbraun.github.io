At this risk of this only being funny to a few, I decided to share it anyway. But first, let me explain.

Here at Brigham Young University, there is a culture of dating that is unparalleled by anywhere else in the world. I don't know all the reasons why it is... but it certainly is. And with everybody trying their best to impress that special someone, there are a few patterns that are easily recognizable to the observing bystander. And this is what they are:

1.  Every girl finds one excuse after another to cook delicious treats or meals for that boy they adore, demonstrating just how domestically fabulous they are.
2.  Every guy teaches himself just enough guitar to be able to play "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJtYqBYCV8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Hey There Delilah - YouTube">Hey there Delilah</a>" and watch that lovely lady just melt into a pile of swooning admiration.

It makes sense right? The most direct pathway to a man's heart is through his stomach. And nothing says, "I'm sensitive" quite like the line "Times Square can't shine as bright as you... I swear it's true." Now don't get me wrong, the song is great! And so is free food. But if you are a BYU student and you were planning on pulling one of these stunts, then just forget about it... the novelty has already worn thin.

And that is why this amazing Parody was written (appropriately to the tune of Hey there Delilah). I've seen my fair share of these but this one really nailed it. Enjoy!

  Hey there Delilah<br /> What's it like in Alpine Village?<br /> I'm only three floors away<br /> But girl, tonight I feel so hungry<br /> Yes I do<br /> J-Dawgs can't cook as good as you<br /> I swear it's true
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Hey there Delilah<br /> Don't you worry about the peanuts<br /> I don't have food allergies<br /> I will eat anything you bring us<br /> Like cherry pie,<br /> Chocolate frosty, on the side<br />and also fries
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Oh it's what you cook for me (x4)<br /> What you cook for me
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Hey there Delilah<br /> I know dating can be hard<br /> But just believe me, girl<br /> Between your cooking skills and my guitar<br /> We'll have it good<br /> We'll have the dates we knew we would<br /> Your food is good
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Hey there Delilah<br /> I might ask you out today<br /> Since every cookie makes me think of you<br /> How 'bout just one more plate<br /> I'll eat it all<br /> Even more in love with you I'd fall<br /> I'll eat them all
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Oh it's what you cook for me (x4)
</p>

  The Creamery seems pretty far<br /> But I know your roommates all have cars<br /> Just walk there if you have no other way<br /> Our friends would all make fun of us<br /> and we'll just laugh along because we know<br /> That none of them have had your cakes<br /> Delilah I will eat for you<br /> Through your fridge and cupboards too<br /> My gut will never ever be the same<br /> and you're to blame
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Hey there Delilah<br /> I am craving some Rice Crispey's<br /> Two more years and we'll be done with school<br /> and you'll be making cookies like you do<br /> We'll be married because of you<br /> I'll eat whenever I want to<br /> Hey there Delilah here's to you<br /> This cookie's for you
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Oh it's what you cook for me (x4)<br /> What you cook for me.

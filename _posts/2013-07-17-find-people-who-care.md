It's easy to find, interview, and hire competent people. People who can write code. People who can spin up a spreadsheet. People who can launch an ad campaign. We've got lots of college graduates out there who took classes where they learned to do these things.

What's rare is the person who cares. The person who believes in the big picture of where you are going. The person who's willing to put themselves on the line during hundreds of tiny decisions along the way, because it matters to them. That person is out there, and they could be on your team.

Your job is to find them, set a clear vision for them, and get out of their way.

While I was living in South Africa, I spent 3 weeks being constant companions with a guy I had zero things in common with. I was a white American raised in a middle class home in the suburbs. He was a black South African Zulu, raised in poverty in a government-built township during Apartheid. He had spent all of his life living on the other side of this planet from me, immersed in a language, culture, lifestyle, and religion that was completely foreign to me. Communicating was difficult. One morning, desperate to find some common ground for discussion, I remember asking him what sports he liked. He said, "cricket." I only knew cricket was a sport because you could select it as an option when building a stadium in Sim City 2000.

At some point I realized that if I just kept asking questions, then we could break down the communication barrier. If I ask he'll have to answer, right? So, I asked about his family, his school, and his background. I felt like a broken record, but the more I asked the more I learned and we started to build some understanding.

I used to think that smart people didn't ask questions. It sure seemed like that in school. But I was wrong. Smart people are the ones who ask questions the most.

I'm not the best at this... as an introvert, I feel a bit uncomfortable asking questions in many settings. But [I'm working to improve][1]. I've come to realize that the habit of asking questions provides [compounding benefits][2] to your knowledge and relationships for years to come.

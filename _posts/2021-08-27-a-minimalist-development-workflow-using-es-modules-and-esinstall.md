When a new-ish web developer wants to start building a frontend JavaScript application these days, they typically reach for a project-starting toolâ€”like [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) or [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)â€”to set up their codebase. This works and gets you running quickly, but it's at the cost of massive tooling complexity abstracted beneath the surface (if you don't believe me, check your `node_modules` directory)!

Fortunately, we can bypass this complexity by skipping the bundler and using ECMAScript modules in our apps directly (browser support for modules [is good now](https://caniuse.com/es6-module)). This is a big deal! As [DHH recently said](https://world.hey.com/dhh/modern-web-apps-without-javascript-bundling-or-transpiling-a20f2755), "*An entire class of complexity stands at the precipice.*" The only problem is that lots of 3rd-party JavaScript packages continue to only export to CommonJS, making them incompatible with ES module apps.

In this post, I'll share a how we can use [esinstall](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/esinstall) to pull in *any* 3rd-party package as an ES module, thus unlocking a minimalist, bundle-free development workflow for modern JavaScript apps.

## Setup: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

To get set up, we just need a basic HTML file, that pulls in `style.css` for styles and `main.js` as our JavaScript entrypoint:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>My Project</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

By declaring `type="module"` on our script tag, we're safe to use `import` and `export` statements in `main.js` without needing a bundler. ðŸ’ª

## Pulling in dependencies

To pull in dependencies, we'll create a basic `package.json` and list them under `dependencies` like normal. Here's an example, pulling in a `dom-confetti` package:

```json
{
  "name": "esinstall-demo",
  "dependencies": {
    "dom-confetti": "^0.2.2",
  }
}
```

`dom-confetti` only exports to CommonJS, so we're not able to import it into our app yet. This is where `esinstall` comes in.

## esinstall

`esinstall` is a development tool that converts any JavaScript package into a single ES6-module-friendly file that you can check into your codebase and `import`. You can run this conversion just once on install, so there's no need to set up file watching or other unnecessary tooling.

To set it up, we'll update our `package.json` like so:

```json
{
  "name": "esinstall-demo",
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node install-modules.mjs"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "dom-confetti": "^0.2.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "esinstall": "^1.1.7"
  },
  "esinstall": {
    "install": [
      "dom-confetti"
    ]
  }
}
```

This includes a few important changes:

* We declared `esinstall` as a dev-dependency, so we can use it for our one-time builds.
* We set up a new "esinstall" section, for listing any packages we want to install as ES modules.
* We created a [`postinstall` script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/scripts) that will run after every `npm install`.

This `postinstall` script runs a small node script that I've created called `install-modules.mjs`. All this script does is gets the list of modules from our package.json and runs them through `esinstall`:

```js
// install-modules.mjs

import { install } from 'esinstall';
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';

const json = JSON.parse(
  await readFile(
    new URL('./package.json', import.meta.url)
  )
);
const moduleList = json.esinstall.install;
const installOptions = json.esinstall.installOptions;

await install(moduleList, installOptions);
```

Now all we need to do is run `npm install` and our `dom-confetti` package gets converted to an ES Module and dropped into a `web_modules` folder, ready for us to import:

```js
// main.js

import { confetti } from "./web_modules/dom-confetti.js";

confetti(document.body, { angle: 0 });
```

## Is that all we need?

Pretty much! Now you can organize everything in your codebase as modules and ship them straight to the browser bundle-free. If you have questions about things like caching, performance, or browser support, feel free to check out my earlier post, [ES modules in production: my experience so far](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2020/10/23/es-modules-in-production-my-experience-so-far/).

## Snowpack

If this build workflow seems familiar then you might recognize it from  [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/) v1 / v2. Those earlier versions of Snowpack supported [this exact workflow]({{site.url}}/2020/08/28/a-minimalist-development-workflow-using-es6-modules-and-snowpack/), but v3 ended up moving to a different workflow that worked more like webpack (with file watching, transpiling, and more). This new workflow allowed Snowpack to compete more directly with Webpack for larger, more enterprisey projects that needed transpiling to convert JSX, Typescript, and other niceties. While that made Snowpack more powerful, it could no longer be used as a simple "modules in production" build tool. [:(](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/discussions/2107)

Fortunately, the Snowpack team decided to take that core functionality for converting code to ES modules, name it `esinstall` and publish it as [it's' own package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esinstall). Snowpack still uses this code internally, which makes me feel pretty confident that it'll remain a stable development tool for a while.

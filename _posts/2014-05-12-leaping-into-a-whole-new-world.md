Occasionally, I'll get an opportunity to [leap][1] into a whole new world.

Maybe it's picking up a new programming language, or learning photoshop. Maybe it's moving overseas, [ordering the octopus][2], or investing money in something.

Whatever it is, whether it's large or small, it's always a little scary.

This new world could be difficult or painful. There's no guarantee that I'll like it or that I'll succeed. What if life in this world gets hard?

But, realize that life will never not be hard. Us humans have a seemingly infinite capacity to be unsatisfied with our situation. If all your problems were gone tomorrow, and they never came back, you'd start becoming more sensitive to a new layer of problems. You could hypothetically live in a climate controlled room, shut off from the rest of the world, with all your needs brought to you on conveyors, and you'll still find something to complain about. There will always be a burr in your boot.

Your [capacity grows to fill your challenges][3]Â and this life is more about increasing your capacity than it is about eliminating your problems.

So go ahead. Leap!

I've talked about [the value of freeing information][1], but consider a practical question: How do we do it?

Here's a couple rough thoughts.

* Look at major information crowdsourcing initiatives and find ways to [reduce friction][2] in the contribution workflow and lower the barrier of entry. Treat it like e-commerce, and optimize, optimize, optimize.
* Find ways to gamify or incentivize the curation and collection of crowd sourced information online (like [this guy does][3]).
* Find ways to improve SEO on major information crowd sourcing projects.
* Improve the design of crowdsourcing sites.
* In technical writing classes, have students write technical tutorials, how-to's, instructions, etc., and post all the assignments online. Do something similar for personal finance classes and other courses as appropriate. Bonus points go to people who drive traffic.
* Have journalism classes move their school newspapers and newsletters online, or publish to both physical and tangible.
* Have journalism students start blogs.
* Ask yourself if you have any personal documents that could be posted online. Old photos of people and places? Childhood memories? Family history information? Old assignments from school?
* Ask organizations if they'd be willing to make some of their information public. Maybe [salary information][4]? Employee count over time? Branch locations? Corporate culture and mythology?
* [Build a wiki][5] for your community.
* Change [nagware software][6] so that instead of reminding you to purchase with a registration pop-up or a demo timer, it makes the user solve [ReCaptchas][7] instead.
* Assign programming students to work in the issue queues of open source projects.
* [Petition the Government][8] to publicly release archived government documents like court cases, salary information, and various reports. For data already released, petition to have it released in machine readable formats, and APIs.
* Donate money to organizations like [archive.org][9] and [creative commons][10].
* Design an open source platform for "Open Data" initiatives, allowing organizations to input data in a variety of easy formats and have that data automatically downloadable and exposed as an API.
* Find already "free" documents that are difficult to get to and make them more easily accessible. For example, make valuable PDF documents available in HTML or make valuable plain-text documents available in [markdown][11].
* More hyperlinks.
* Set up an endowment, which pays for the hosting of a valuable website off of interest dividends alone, ensuring that the site can remain up, essentially, forever.
* Create volunteer opportunities to do things like the above.
* Create a [Kickstarter][12] campaign to fund initiatives like those listed above.
* Create organizations that provide internship opportunities to do the above.
* Start a non-profit with the goal of implementing the ideas above, so the initiatives can be backed by funding.

Many of these ideas aren't new. There are success stories like [Wikipedia Zero][13], [Stack Overflow][14], [ReCaptcha][15], and [Google Summer of Code][16]. But we need more and better implementations. Each one is step towards a future where information is evenly distributed and available to all who need it.

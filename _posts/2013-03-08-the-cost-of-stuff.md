It isn't just the dollars and cents on the price tag. Yes, that's the upfront cost, but if you base your purchases on that alone, you may be in for a sour deal.

Have you considered:

* The cost on the environment
* The cost on your health, or potential health risk
* The cost of your effort every time you need to move it
* The cost of it forcing you to exert mental energy
* The cost of future time that you will spend using it
* The ongoing cost of it taking up space in your house
* The ongoing cost of maintenance
* The ongoing cost of cleaning
* The ongoing cost of keeping it organized
* The ongoing cost of it distracting you
* The ongoing cost of it worrying you
* The tolls of all these costs on your friends, family, and neighbors

When I think of the total cost, it's hard for me to find much that is worth buying.

The problem with being unremarkable is that your work isn't worth remarking about. It doesn't matter if you're doing your best. I've got several <a href="{{site.url}}/projects">unremarkable sites on my portfolio page</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bryanbraun?tab=repositories">several unremarkable projects on my Github profile</a>. Guess what… nobody ever asks me about them. Sure, some turned out good. They were the product of me doing my best at different stages in my life. But doing your best doesn't make something remarkable.

I recently read somebody who opined that in order to really make a mark you've got to be the best in the world. I confess, I doubt I'll ever be the best web developer in the world. Que sad music.

But it's ok, because I can shrink my world. If not the best web developer, then perhaps the best front-end developer. If not that, then maybe the best front-end Drupal web developer. If not that, then maybe the best front-end Drupal web developer with a focus on admin experience. It doesn't matter what your industry is… if you keep shrinking your world, you can eventually become the best.

If you are doing your best, your Mom cares. The world won't care until you're the best in the world.

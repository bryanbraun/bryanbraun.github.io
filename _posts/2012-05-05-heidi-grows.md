I confess, I never look at other people's baby pictures on Facebook. I'm not sure why... sometimes it seems like all babies look the same.

All, except for one, that is. I realize that it has been over a year since I last posted pictures of Heidi. She has grown a lot since then. She laughs, she mimics us, she can throw a ball, ask for things, and even dance to music. She brings happiness into our lives each day.

If you are the type that does look at baby pictures, then I hope these are as precious to you as they are to me (unlikely).

How good are these site builders? *I don't know.*

Are you worried about job security? *I have two thoughts…*

## 1. We've seen this before

Wordpress, Squarespace, Shopify, Webflow... all these tools made it easier for anyone to spin up a basic website. And yet, the world has always needed more web developers. Why? Well, some people need more than just a basic website. Some people are trying to build apps and tools that have never been built before. A lot of my current work is supporting custom features that span multiple teams, codebases, and services. I think we're still a long way from AI doing all of that.

## 2. The world is always changing

Maybe this time it's different, and the tools really will make web developers obsolete (including me). If so, what then?

I'd lose my job. That sucks. But when I think about it, I don't want a job per se. I want security and fulfillment.

There are a lot of paths to security and fulfillment and I don't think my current job, or even my current career, is the only one. It takes some effort and creativity to get yourself into a career that works for you but I've done it before and I can do it again. I know my strengths and weaknesses, and there is no shortage of interesting problems in the world. Who knows, maybe I can use AI to help me solve some of them.

The world is always changing. We can try to resist it, or we can change with it.

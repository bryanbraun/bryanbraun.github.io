From [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) to [Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-your-copilot-for-work/), we're seeing a wave of AIs that can write and write well.

In a recent post, Jim Nielsen described how having AIs write for us is a trade-off:

> "Writing is a moment for self-reflection, for providing the space and time necessary for the conception of thoughts or feelings that can change your heart or mind. Offloading that task to AI is not necessarily a net-gain, it is a trade-off. One to make consciously."

That made me think about my own writing. If I had to break down my current writing activity (not counting code), it would look something like this:

- 10% - Journaling
- 10% - [Blog posts]({{site.url}}/blog/)
- 20% - Texting and Personal Emails
- 10% - Meeting notes / todos
- 35% - Programming notes (usually to help me work through tricky coding issues)
- 15% - [Book notes]({{site.url}}/books/)

Could I hand any of these over to AI?

Definitely no on the journaling and blog posts, since those are basically pure self-reflection. It's me figuring out what I believe. I could augment that a bit with spelling and grammar check tools, but it's hard to imagine offloading more without compromising [the process](http://www.paulgraham.com/words.html).

For texting and emails I already use autocomplete and [Smart Compose](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/9116836?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). I also use Gmail templates for frequent responses, so I can't see how I could automate this much further.

Personal notes (for meetings, books, and coding) seems the most promising but I don't think AI can do this for me either. When I take notes, I'm only interested in writing out the stuff that matters to me. Every book I read has a hundred summaries on the internet, each more detailed and comprehensive than mine, but I still take [book notes]({{site.url}}/books/) because I want to remember [what impacted me](https://sive.rs/bfaq). Even if an AI knew what those things were, delegating that work would defeat the purpose.

So maybe I don't want AIs to take over my writing but that doesn't mean it's useless. Autocomplete, grammar check, and Smart Compose... these tools are already AI powered. As AI tech progresses, I expect these tools to improve and become more pervasive, impacting my writing in little ways, mostly from the margins.

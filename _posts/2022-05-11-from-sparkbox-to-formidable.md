Several months ago, I handed in my computer and wrapped up my employment at Sparkbox.

I've wanted to blog about the changeâ€”to share some experiences I had and things I learned along the way. But the words just didn't seem to want to come.

The truth is, on the night that I submitted my notice, I laid awake in bed unable to sleep. When I joined Sparkbox 7 years ago, it felt so right... I couldn't imagine ever leaving. And yet, here I was.

Fortunately, I've been sleeping better recently. I'm now 3 months into my new role as a (Frontend) Software Engineer at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/) and I'm confident that it was the right choice. It feels good!

Change can be intimidating, but it has been necessary for every great opportunity I've had. I think its always going to be like that.

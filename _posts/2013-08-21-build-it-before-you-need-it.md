<p class="p1">
  The most important things in this world cannot be bought. They must be built.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Things like an audience of people who are interested in what you're interested in. People who will be willing to listen when you have something important to say.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Things like a reputation. When you're in a tight spot and you give somebody your word, will it be enough?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Things like trust. Whether you are aware of it or not, people around you decide whether or not to endorse you every time your name comes up in conversation. Do they trust you enough to endorse you with confidence?
</p>

<p class="p1">
  These things take time to build. Months. Even years.
</p>

<p class="p1">
  Build it before you need it.

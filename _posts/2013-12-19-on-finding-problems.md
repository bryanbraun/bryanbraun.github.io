It's tempting to find problems. The world is full of them, and we get attention (sweet, sweet, attention) for pointing them out.

But it comes at a cost--one explained nicely in [this post by Rajesh Setty][1].Â Negativity is poisonous, and you don't want its ill effects in your life.

If you want to your net contribution to the world to be positive, there's a higher road:

1.  Find a problem
2.  Think of a solution
3.  Build the solution
4.  Share it

Paradoxically, this pattern of behavior is both noble and rare enough that if you follow through with it consistently, you won't have a problem getting attention after all.

Here are some things I made in 2023:

- An [Alfred workflow for purging Cloudflare's cache](https://github.com/bryanbraun/cloudflare-purge-alfred-workflow)
- A [Chrome Extension for adding googly eyes to any webpage](https://github.com/bryanbraun/googly)
- A [tutorial video for building your own texture pack in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVA9HfIvQlc)
- [Let's Get Creative](https://www.bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative/)
- A [music box song for Mice on Venus (Minecraft)](https://musicbox.fun/#1XQAAAAKCAgAAAAAAAABBqEgrkn_FugMYQwoROL_plV5lzTZ183dlE-iiJ7-iX7mQXa9yXOBc6FuGC33ZUlP1k9HHSGhw4KGakLgYwwHc2HHxHZy1elWVPVzh2demKJhkV3lASBwcnLI-vq2_VaGjXo9QZ7LuUV2p9XGaHdZhjfIGcL7hORwA7BogpxcE1ZeHDyIoskVsHU6Ai9Z8lYKHO7FsnbH_IlyGoLlnvSU_liCqJzIeGvnjfQgHEprSKRTDHFimYCkkgxhw2wssdmakNkdFnWT1uvzGx6qbUsKNyeHOArhVOIgh0v7K5e139rGQPEn3IoxIvKuE8LIsLDu5WOc01OOAtdJEsaJMfczEDekVI6VpdIDFnaO0nOLLycN2KYU8xlpAONDpsOIaTw7l1dkwiqbyTK5sJ0ZsA_U5tF4Vfu_MEdvZ6shxDCZsTs5ywTltqJqmnLm2gA9Uh22OK8g18A195ffCvG4xBvDKcjeM2Y_Od4sAsC3BRqat21eK6PvPOkni_5A5j0OqSAj1VWJ1KOc_Fib_opTBM7H4aifM9X7ILowJiomYW_2yadAR2OGzFp-gqR6GpJxurfa1PsDj0v_uCaro)
- [18 blog posts on bryanbraun.com]({{site.url}}/blog/#y2023), including [a four-post series about online media and RSS]({{site.url}}/2023/11/26/i-needed-to-be-happier/).

This year marked a slow return to some side-projects after [a general haitus in 2022]({{site.url}}/2023/01/03/made-in-2022/). I used AI to help me build the first two projects listed above, but the others were all me. "Let's Get Creative" was the biggest and most satisfying thing I made.

I could also list things I made in the physical world but I haven't done much of that, outside of house maintenance. I *did* do a lot of cooking this year and I while I don't have much to show for it now, I'd like to believe that I learned some useful skills. I'm confident that any cooking skills I pick up will remain relevant far longer than my ReactJS skills.

New opportunities await. Here's to 2024. ⛵️

Give a bad speech. Do it again and again.

Are you embarrassed by your writing skills?

Write a bad blog post. Do it again and again.

Are you bad at articulating your thoughts, cutting to the root of a challenging problem, asking for favors, cold calling, pitching an idea, or sharing a project that isn't perfect?

You know the drill.

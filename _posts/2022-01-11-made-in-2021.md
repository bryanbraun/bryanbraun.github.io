Here are some things I made in 2021:

- [Infinitely nested iFrames]({{site.url}}/infinitely-nested-iframes/) (more details [in the blog post here]({{site.url}}/2021/03/24/infinitely-nested-iframes/)).
- New [Checkboxland]({{site.url}}/checkboxland) demos, including [Ripple]({{site.url}}/checkboxland/docs/demos/ripple/), [Spiral]({{site.url}}/checkboxland/docs/demos/spiral/), [Pinwheel]({{site.url}}/checkboxland/docs/demos/pinwheel/), [Lasers]({{site.url}}/checkboxland/docs/demos/lasers/), [Webcam]({{site.url}}/checkboxland/docs/demos/webcam-test/), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGvXdYXami4), and a couple others (more details [in the blog post here]({{site.url}}/2021/09/21/i-keep-making-things-out-of-checkboxes/)).
- [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/bryanbraun/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021) (more details [in this blog post here]({{site.url}}/2022/01/10/lessons-learned-from-advent-of-code/)).
- [14 blog posts on bryanbraun.com]({{site.url}}/blog/#y2021)
- 7 music box songs on [musicboxfun.com](https://musicboxfun.com)

Compared to years past, this list is pretty short. I'm ok with that. Just having the space in my life to exercise a little creativity here and there is something to be grateful for. We'll see what 2022 brings.

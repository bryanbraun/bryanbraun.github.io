At least according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon's_Law">Sturgeon's Law</a>. So you can take this a couple ways.

* If your work isn't crap, then congratulations! You're way ahead of the game.
* If you're working your butt off, and your work is still crap, then <a href="{{site.url}}/2012/03/19/never-settle-being-mediocre">don't settle</a>, but don't worry. Sometimes you have to plow through the crap to incrementally improve until your work is really good.

At least, that's what I keep telling myself.

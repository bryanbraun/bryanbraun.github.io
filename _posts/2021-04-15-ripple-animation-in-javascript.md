*I wanted to create a ripple animation recently but I had a hard time finding an online explanation that fit my needs. That post didn't exist so I decided to write it. I hope it helps someone!*

We'd like to build a ripple animation like this one:

<div class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple.gif" alt="Animation of a black and white animated ripple." />
</div>

Eventually, we'll be drawing this ripple in Javascript, but *the primary goal of this post is to walk through the math behind the animation, step by step*. If we can understand how the math works, we can create the animation, change it without fear, and build other similar animations using JavaScript or any other programming language.

## The ripple as a sine wave

This ripple is based on a sine wave.

As a reminder, sine is a mathematical function that looks like this:

![A sine function, graphed, using Desmos.com]({{site.url}}/assets/images/sine-function.png)

The ripple we are building is viewed from the overhead perspective, but if we placed our eye level at the surface of the water, we'd see that the shape of the ripple's surface matches the sine wave:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple-single-direction.png" alt="The sine wave, superimposed on our ripple." />
  <figcaption>The white bands are the peaks of the wave and the dark bands are the troughs.</figcaption>
</figure>

The full shape of the ripple can be represented with many sine waves, beginning at the center and emanating out in all directions:

![Many sine waves, superimposed on our ripple]({{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple-all-directions.png)

So we can see the sine waves in our ripple, but how do we draw it with code?

## Understanding our coordinates

Many graphics programming environments like HTML5 Canvas give you a coordinate system with the origin in the top-left, like this:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/canvas_default_grid.png" alt="The coordinate system of HTML canvas, with the origin in the top left." />
  <figcaption>Each pixel is defined by its x and y coordinate</figcaption>
</figure>

Since our ripple has a clear center in the middle, it would be more convenient to move our origin to the center, like this:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple-coordinates.png" alt="Our ripple with a coordinate system superimposed on it." />
  <figcaption>When viewed from overhead, the the plane defined by the X and Y axis represents the surface of the water, while the Z axis points out of the screen directly at us.</figcaption>
</figure>

In this system, a sine wave travelling down the X-axis would move up and down the Z-axis as it went (with Y staying at 0 the whole time). This wave could be defined by this function:

```
z = sin(x)
```
For any x we provide, the function gives us z, the elevation of the wave at that location. Since our image is 2D (being viewed from overhead), we'll plan on mapping our z value to color (instead of position), making the larger z's lighter and the smaller z's darker.

## Calculating every pixel

`z = sin(x)` works fine for waves on travelling down the X-axis, but what about the rest of the scene?

Many graphics environments (like Canvas and WebGL) work by looping through each pixel and giving you a chance to calculate what it should look like. With that in mind, lets look at a random pixel in our scene:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple-pixel.png" alt="A light blue pixel located within the ripple image." />
  <figcaption>Our pixel of interest is the light blue dot.</figcaption>
</figure>

As you can see, this pixel lives at the location `(x, y)`, which makes two sides of a right triangle.

Consider this: **the hypotenuse of this triangle, is the path of this pixel's sine wave.**

This means that if we knew the length of the hypotenuse, we could drop that distance into our sine function and get the correct wave elevation at that pixel. This works for every pixel in the scene, so now we can generalize our sine function:

```
# Where d represents the distance between any point and the origin.
z = sin(d)
```

We can calculate `d` for any pixel by using Pythagorean's theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple-pythagorean.png" alt="A visualization of Pythagorean's theorem" />
</figure>

Now we have all of the mathematical pieces we need to draw the ripple. ðŸ™Œ

## Drawing the ripple in JavaScript

We'll start by just drawing the non-animated ripple, using the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API). Specifically, we'll use [createImageData](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D/createImageData), which allows us to draw an image, one pixel at a time. Here's the setup:

**HTML:**
```html
<canvas id="canvas" width="300" height="300"></canvas>
```

**JAVASCRIPT**
```js
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

function drawRipple() {
  const pixelData = ctx.createImageData(canvas.width, canvas.height);

  // @todo: manipulate the the pixelData here

  ctx.putImageData(pixelData, 0, 0);
}

drawRipple();
```

This doesn't render anything to the canvas yet. We can look at `pixelData` to see why:

```
console.log(pixelData);

â€¦

{
  width: 300,
  height: 300,
  data: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, â€¦]
}
```

`pixelData.data` is a single array (technically, a `Uint8ClampedArray`) containing all the pixel data in our 300x300 image. Each set of four numbers represents the [RGBA color values](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/RGBA) for a given pixel:

```
[ R, G, B, A,  R, G, B, A,  R, G, B, A, â€¦]
 â””â”€ Pixel 1 â”€â”˜â””â”€ Pixel 2 â”€â”˜â””â”€ Pixel 3 â”€â”˜
```

Thus, when the array is full of 0s, we end up with a 300x300 transparent black image.

Now, lets loop over the array and change the pixel values to draw our ripple:

```js

function drawRipple() {
  const pixelData = ctx.createImageData(canvas.width, canvas.height);

  // Step through the array one pixel at a time
  for (let i = 0; i < pixelData.data.length; i += 4) {

    // We can find our (x, y) position on the canvas by comparing
    // our position in the array with the width of the canvas.
    let x = Math.floor(i / 4) % canvas.width;
    let y = Math.floor(i / (4 * canvas.width));

    // We need our origin to be in the center, so lets convert the (x, y)
    // from above (the "canvas coordinates") to their "reindexed" values
    // (what they would become if the origin were in the center).
    let reIndexedX = -((canvas.width - x) - (canvas.width / 2));
    let reIndexedY = (canvas.height - y) - (canvas.height / 2);

    // Instead of writing our own code for Pythagorean's theorem, we can
    // use JavaScript's built-in method to calculate the hypotenuse.
    let distance = Math.hypot(reIndexedX, reIndexedY);
    let waveHeight = Math.sin(distance);

    // Normally, a sin wave fluctuates between -1 and 1, but we want ours
    // to fluctuate between 0 and 255 instead (the range for RGB values).
    // Lets adjust the wave height to produce that 0-255 range.
    let adjustedHeight = (waveHeight * (255/2)) + (255/2);

    // Assign the adjustedHeight to R, G, and B equally, to make gray.
    pixelData.data[i]     = adjustedHeight; // red
    pixelData.data[i + 1] = adjustedHeight; // green
    pixelData.data[i + 2] = adjustedHeight; // blue
    pixelData.data[i + 3] = 255;            // opacity
  }

  ctx.putImageData(pixelData, 0, 0);
}

```

This is what we get:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple-first-attempt.png" alt="A compressed black and white ripple." />
  <figcaption>It's working! It's also making me a little dizzy.</figcaption>
</figure>

It looks we need to make a few minor adjustments to our sin wave. For things like this, I highly recommend [desmos.com](https://www.desmos.com/) online graphing calculator.  They've got [a great example sin function](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/w9jrdpvsmk) that allows you to tweak all the variables.

These were all the changes I needed:

```diff
- let waveHeight = Math.sin(radialX);
+ let waveHeight = Math.sin(radialX / 8);
- let adjustedHeight = (waveHeight * (255/2)) + (255/2);
+ let adjustedHeight = (waveHeight * 60) + (255/2);
```

<div class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple.png" alt="The complete ripple image." />
</div>

## Animating the ripple

To see how to animate it, we can again turn to desmos.com to see which variables of the sine wave we should change over time:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/desmos.gif" alt="A rippling wave, animated on desmos.com." />
  <figcaption>Pressing "play" on the <em>h</em> value translates the whole wave, just like we want to do on our ripple.</figcaption>
</figure>

To animate the wave in JavaScript, we can use `requestAnimationFrame` to repeatedly call our `drawRipple()` function, and pass in a timestamp to adjust the wave position each time. Doing this only requires a few changes to our function above:


```js
const startTime = performance.now();

(function drawRipple(timestamp) {
  const elapsedTimeUnits = (timestamp - startTime) / 50;

  â‹®

  // Update the sin() function with a value based on the timestamp
  // For reference, see https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bp9t79pfa0
  let waveHeight = Math.sin((radialX - elapsedTimeUnits) / 8);

  â‹®

  requestAnimationFrame(drawRipple);
})(startTime);
```

And with that, our animation looks like this:

<figure class="center">
  <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/images/ripple.gif" alt="Animation of a black and white animated ripple." />
  <figcaption>You can play with <a href="https://codepen.io/bryanbraun/pen/PoWeVMR">the full code for the animated ripple here on Codepen</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

## Future enhancements

Theres a lot more we could do to enhance the animation. For example:

- Change the color values to create a blue "water-like" ripple or a psychedelic rainbow ripple.
  - For example, [here's one I made with different colors](https://codepen.io/bryanbraun/pen/NWdwBrR)
- Allow the user to click to define a new "center" location for the ripple.
- Attenuate the ripple so the waves die down the further they get from the center.
  - I played around with this on Desmos.com and [here's what that looks like mathematically](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/aynjzx4p34). Isn't Desmos great?
- Try animating it using [Processing](https://processing.org/), [Tixy.land](https://tixy.land/), or [Checkboxland](https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1379290968587919363).
- See if you can figure out how to turn the ripple into a spiral.

As long as you understand the underlying math, you can tweak and adjust the animation to your heart's content.

*Note: For a different approach to programming a ripple, see [this video tutorial by Daniel Shiffman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZUdGqeOD0w). In it he uses a "neighboring pixels" algorithm instead of sine waves, which produces some neat effects (like the ability for waves to reflect off walls). Check it out!*

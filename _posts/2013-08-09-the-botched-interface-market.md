Scott Adams of <a href="http://dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a> fame talked about something he called <a href="http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/botched_interface_market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Botched Interface Market">the botched interface market</a>. Basically, it's when a site or technology with a poor interface leaves an opening in the market for some contender to come in and replicate the functionality with a much better interface. That's how <a href="http://www.hipmunk.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hipmunk</a> came in and made travel companies like Orbtiz and Travelocity scramble to redesign their websites. In retrospect it seems obvious… <a href="{{site.url}}/2013/08/04/the-interface-is-the-software">the interface IS the software</a>, after all.

There are a lot of botched interfaces out there. Have you ever caught yourself thinking, "Man, I wish <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Apple">Apple</a> designed a microwave?" That's a botched interface. Personally, I see a ton of opportunity in B2B software… the category that user experience forgot. Seriously. Have you ever had a pleasant experience filling out an online expense report? What about completing a timesheet or using an enterprise CMS? See what I mean?

The twist is that, to some degree, every interface is botched. Even good interfaces live in blissful ignorance of the fact that a better one is possible, even if it only exists in it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_Forms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Plato's Theory of Forms">platonic form</a>, waiting to be created. At any moment, somebody else could sneak up on you and start eating marketshare.

Better to never get comfortable.

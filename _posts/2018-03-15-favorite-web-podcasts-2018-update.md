Back in 2013 (holy moly that was 5 years ago), I posted a [list of my favorite web-technology-related podcasts]({{site.url}}/2013/09/26/best-of-the-web-podcasts/). Here's my updated list of favorites for 2018:

* [Javascript Jabber](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber)
* [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/)
* [Rework](https://rework.fm/)
* [Y Combinator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/y-combinator/id1236907421?mt=2)
* [IndieHackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/podcast)

It's hard to believe that I don't listen to _any_ of the ones on my original list anymore (though I do check [The Changelog](https://changelog.com/podcast) occasionally to see if there's a good topic). Many of those original podcasts aren't updated anymore. That makes me feel weird.

This list also includes fewer podcasts about specific technologies, and more about business and the industry in general.

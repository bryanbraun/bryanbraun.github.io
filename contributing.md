## Local Setup

This site uses Jekyll, a static site builder written in Ruby.

1. Make sure you have a local ruby environment set up on your computer (including ruby and [bundler](https://bundler.io/)).
    * For best results, use a local ruby version that matches [the ruby version used on Github's servers](https://pages.github.com/versions.json).
2. Use bundler to install Jekyll and other ruby dependencies: `bundle install`
3. Run the site: `jekyll serve`

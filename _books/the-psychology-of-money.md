This book is about how human psychology affects our personal finances, for better or for worse. I was half-expecting the book to be full of the same behavioral economics principles that I've read about in the past (sunk costs, loss aversion, etc). Instead, it felt like a fresh look at many of the financial situations and tradeoffs that I recognized in my own life. Several topics stood out to me, like: lifestyle inflation (and why it's so difficult to avoid) and the importance of consistency (and the forces that prevent it). Building wealth seems easy in theory but we are unpredictable people living in an unpredictable world. This book felt like an approachable guide to understanding the forces at play.

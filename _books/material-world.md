This book is an in-depth exploration of six raw materials that our modern would is built on. The six materials are sand, salt, iron and steel, copper, crude oil/gas, and lithium, though the definitions were pretty loose (the author's definition of 'salt' included industrial fertilizers). The idea behind the book's title is that most of us are so insulated from the processes that source these materials, that it's like a parallel worldâ€”a world that's both invisible and critical to our way of life. The book goes into great detail providing a history of each material, including its discovery, mining, processing, and scaling up to today. It's a long book, but the author does a great job keeping it interesting by bringing a sense of curiosity and wonder to each chapter. The subject reminded me of playing the video game Factorio, where you spend a lot of time in the "material world" building supply chains for mining and processing materials. It feels like a topic we should all know more about, given how much our modern lives depend on it.

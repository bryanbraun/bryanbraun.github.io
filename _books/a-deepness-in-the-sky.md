This is a science-fiction story set in the far future, after humans have learned to travel between stars and populate other words. The story follows two human factions that are both seeking to make first contact with the only intelligent non-human species to be discovered. As the groups jostle for dominance, we see a clash of technology, principles, and value-systems, with devastating effects. I loved how it wrestled with themes of freedom vs control, power and authoritarianism, and the consequences of obsession. Despite all the science and technology, the story is really about humanity. Very good science-fiction, for anyone who isn't intimidated by a 600+ page book.

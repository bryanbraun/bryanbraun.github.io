I had heard of this concept of "finite" and "infinite" games in the past, and it seemed pretty interesting to me, so when I discovered the book which introduced the concept, I was excited to read it. The book was not what I expected though. It jumps right into defining finite games and infinite games but without any real context or examples. There was no narrative or prose at allâ€”it was like reading "board game instructions" meets "the book of Proverbs." The discussion of games shifted in many directions like, art, history, culture, nature, and religion, but everything was discussed in philosophical and abstract terms. It was frankly difficult to follow, and hard to find application to anything real. I guess I was hoping the book would help me identify finite or infinite games in my life so I could decide whether I wanted to play them (or how I wanted to play them). The book was too abstract for that. Regardless, it seems like it contains some interesting ideas if you're willing to put in the time and effort to unpack them.

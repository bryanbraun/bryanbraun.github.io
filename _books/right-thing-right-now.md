I read nearly everything of Ryan Holiday's so when I learned that he wrote this, I was excited to go through it. Ryan explains that the book is about justice, or more accurately, the principle of justice as the Stoics saw it. This ended up expanding the topic to include virtues like integrity, incorruptibility, and empathy for others. The book pulled stories from the lives of many people involved in causes of justice including Florence Nightingale, Martin Luther King, Harry S. Truman, and Ghandi. I especially enjoyed learning about Ghandi (I should read a full biography about him). There's a tension in the book between being principled and pragmatic, with some examples of standing on principle and others of making compromises to achieve the greater good. Ryan gives no clear direction for these situations, arguing that life is messy and it falls to us to do the best we can at making these kinds of choices (an answer I found less than satisfying). Overall the book had great parts (the afterword was stellar, as usual) but it suffered from a lack of focus. It felt possible that he only wrote it for the sake of writing a book on each of the four cardinal virtues. I'm glad I read it nonetheless.

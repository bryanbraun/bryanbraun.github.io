The Dark Forest is the science fiction sequel to Cixin Liu's award-winning "The Three Body Problem." The storyline picks up where the last one left off, with the people of Earth desperately trying to prepare for the invasion of a hostile alien fleet. This preparation includes the "Wallfacer Project," a species-wide [Hail Mary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary_pass) that gives a few remarkable people access to a massive amount of resources to plan a strategic response known only to them (thus keeping it safe from enemy surveillance). These plans, and how they shake out, constitutes the story. It was clever, gripping, and there were some great twists along the way (despite the pervasive sense of hopelessness throughout). The whole concept of "the Dark Forest" felt like a genuinely novel answer to the Fermi paradox and I think it'll stick in my mind for a while. While you'd likely need to read the first book to not feel lost, I felt like the sequel was more focused and overall better all-around.

This is book two in the Murderbot series. The first one was so short and satisfying that I decided to keep going. In this one, the main character (the SecUnit/Murderbot) tries to learn more about it's past, encounters new characters, and takes on a contract where things get interesting. These books almost feel like episodes in a science-fiction / action series (something like the Mandalorian). I liked the first book better but this one was also good.

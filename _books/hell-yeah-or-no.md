I've enjoyed other books by Derek Sivers so I thought I'd give this one a try. It turned out to be a collection of Derek's blog posts, all loosely connected to the topic of deciding what's worth doing. I've been following Derek's blog for years, so most of the ideas and stories were familiar to me. It's hard to read this after "How to Live," without feeling like the advice in this book is undermined by the other perspectives from that book. That said, I think it makes this book a bit more personal—it's more like "How *I* live" instead of "How *to* live." From that perspective, I appreciated how much Derek and I have in common. I see myself in his [measured responses](https://sive.rs/slow), his desire to [disconnect](https://sive.rs/dc), and [the way he develops future projects](https://sive.rs/futures) ([sound familiar?](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2025/06/21/waiting-is-risky/)). It makes me want to do more writing myself.

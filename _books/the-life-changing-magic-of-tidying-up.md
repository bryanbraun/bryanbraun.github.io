At one level, this book is about keeping your house tidy, which is practical but not that inspiring. But, there's another layer to the book, which is about honestly evaluating your life through the lens of your possessions. When we look for the truth about our possessions, we end up saying things like, "this thing has served it's purpose and it doesn't contribute to the future I want to create for myself." Tidying your house becomes a proxy for organizing your life. The book isn't about cleaning tactics (though it includes some). It's about adopting a way of thinking that allows you to let go of your past and fearlessly embrace your ideal future. That's compelling, and that's why I'll be recommending the book to others in the future.

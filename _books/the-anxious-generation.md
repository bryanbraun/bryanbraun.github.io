In this book, Jonathan Haidt looks at the mental illness crisis facing young people today and argues that it has a single, undeniable cause: early, excessive use of smartphones (and other online technologies). [This isn't a new hypothesis](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/honestly-its-probably-the-phones), but Haidt brings a mountain of data, studies, and evidence (both correlational and causal) to make a strong, defensible case. A key point is that by allowing our children to be raised online, we have crowded out valuable experiences in the physical world that help young people grow, develop confidence, and learn to trust themselves. In short: we've been overprotective in the physical world and underprotective in the digital world. What's the solution? Haidt proposes [four new norms](https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/pdfs/four-norms.pdf) for parents and schools to adopt. I love theseâ€”they are simple, inexpensive, concrete, and memorable. This year, my wife and I became parents of a teenage girl, so reading this book felt like the responsible thing to do. I'm glad we did, and I strongly recommend it to all parents of preteen kids (in part because changing norms is a collective action problem and we need your help). For a taste of the book's content, check out [Haidt's popular blog post](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/social-media-mental-illness-epidemic) on the topic (or [his other related ones](https://www.afterbabel.com/archive)). Important book!

This is the first book in a science fiction series about a super-advanced human society. The concept seemed interesting to me, but this book spent most of it's time following a band of space-pirates as they fly across the galaxy attempting to make a living in the midst of a galactic war. It took a while for me to get oriented in the setting, and while the story was certainly action-packed, I had a hard time connecting with the characters.

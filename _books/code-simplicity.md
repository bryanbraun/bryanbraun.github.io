This book provides a framework of guiding principles for software development and does so with a high concentration of wisdom per sentence. Instead of getting caught up in implementation details or specific languages, it looks at the big picture: Why are we making software in the first place? What makes us successful? How do we make good decisions? It cuts to the core of the issues, distilling out concrete principles and exposing developer fallacies along the way; I was very pleased with the result. If you're a web developer, this is a great no-nonsense read.

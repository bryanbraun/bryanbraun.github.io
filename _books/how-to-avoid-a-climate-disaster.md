This is a book about climate change and the solutions we'll need to develop to prevent a climate crisis. Because climate change is happening, the book gives us a window into the likely future of R&D spending on energy, construction, transportation, food, and other foundational technologies. These technologies are super interesting to me because I feel like they have the biggest ability to impact people's cost and quality of life. I expected some promising potential solutions (like batteries) but others were more surprising to me (like electric grid upgrades, better liquid fuels, and better fertilizer management). My interests lean towards the technology but there was also plenty of discussion about policy (which convinced me of the need to put a price on carbon). All these topics can be intimidating but Bill does a great job of breaking it down, using concepts like "the green premium" and "getting to zero." Overall, very interesting, practical, and approachable.

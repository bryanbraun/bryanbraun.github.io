I read this book because I wanted to know why its considered a classic in the field of design. Despite the casual title, the book was somewhat academic. It spent a lot of time defining industry terminology and breaking down the process of human-centered design. Along the way, it shared several examples of common UX issues (like oven controls and sink handles). Overall, it was a long read, but it felt pretty relevant (I read the 2013 revised edition which felt pretty modern). I'd have no problems recommending it, especially to somebody just starting out in the industry.

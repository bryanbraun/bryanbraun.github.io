I discovered this book by feeding my list of 200+ book reviews into ChatGPT and asking it to recommend me something I would enjoy. I was not disappointed. Blindsight is a hard science-fiction story about a crew of future humans on a mission to make first contact with an unknown alien presence in the solar system. The crew consists of six hyper-specialized humansâ€”byproducts of genetic engineering and advanced neural surgery. Their attempts to understand the alien presence takes them on a mind-bending journey that leaves them questioning everything they thought they knew. If I had to describe this book in one word, it would be "intense." It was action-packed and suspenseful throughout, with a fair amount of violence (and spicy language). The science and philosophy got pretty deep and I felt myself struggling at times to keep up. It was worth it though, for the mind-blowing ideas it explores around consciousness, evolution, and identity. Even the vampires, which I was initially dismissive of, ended up elevating the story significantly. I left thinking that the author must be some sort of genius to have written this book. I'm definitely going to have to tap ChatGPT for more book recommendations in the future.

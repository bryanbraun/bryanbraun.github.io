Red Mars is the first book in a three-book sci-fi series about humans from Earth colonizing Mars. It starts with the "first hundred" as they make their journey, arrive, and start building infrastructure. As they progress, various conflicts arise, from interpersonal drama to philosophical debates (whether or not to terraform, how they will be governed, etc). The book was reasonably technical and not too speculative (though it's probably 100+ years ahead of where we are today). My biggest complaint was the number of main characters and storylines, which made the book feel a bit tedious (it was 640 pages). I'd still recommend it, if you're the kind of person who likes thinking about Mars colonization.

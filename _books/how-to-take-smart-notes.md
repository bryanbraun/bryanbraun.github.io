This book is all about a note-taking process that claims to help you be a more productive and effective writer and researcher. The process uses a zettelkasten or "slip-box" as a tool for capturing ideas and linking them to each other. This produces a network of clustered ideas that allows research topics to emerge organically, as opposed to a more traditional system that requires you to predefine hierarchical topics and categories that risk becoming irrelevant over time. I liked the concept but I realized part-way through the book that this approach would have limited value to me personally since I don't do much research-to-publish work. Ultimately, that drained my motivation and made it difficult to finish the book (thus, the 2/5 rating). That being said, the note-taking system was compelling and I'd highly recommend this book to anyone whose life revolves around research and publishing research. I may even adopt it to organize topics for my technical blog in the future (especially since there are several good zettelkasten-based note-taking apps out there, like [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)).

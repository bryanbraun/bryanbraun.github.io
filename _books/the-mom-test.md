I've read a couple of books about product validation, but this is the best one I've read so far. Its advice makes so much sense, and yet it's so uncommon. Want to validate your product idea? Then stop talking about your product! Talk to potential customers about their lives. They shouldn't even know they are in a meeting! Avoid mentioning your idea or discussing hypotheticals about the future. If you find yourself in pitch-mode, or on the receiving end of a compliment, you've lost. The book was chock full of stuff like this... very simple principles that make it impossible for you to get bad information. Plus, Rob does an amazing job with the audiobook. It's super casual, as if you're talking to a friend (exactly the vibe you're aiming for in validation conversations). I wish I would have read this years ago.

This was a fictional book following the story of Klara, an advanced humanoid robot (an "AF") who was designed to be a companion for children. We follow along as Klara is purchased from her store, meets Josie, her child, and assists Josie's family as they navigate the challenges of their world. The story is told from Klara's perspective, which lets you see the world like a AI would see it. I loved this aspect of it. Her perspective is naive, often insightful, but also biased by her programming and early formative experiences. It colors everything that happens in the plot, which centers around this question of whether AI's like Klara can fully replace humans. The book had a lot of symbolism, and I was able to discover layers of meaning as the story unfolded (especially in the parts about the sun). I found myself recommending the book to people before I even finished it. It was a joy to read.

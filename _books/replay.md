This book is a fantasy novel about a 43 year old man who dies in the first chapter, only to wake up back in 1963 inside his 18-year old body. With his memories preserved, he proceeds to relive his life a second time (until the process repeats). With each replay, he makes different choices, trying to correct past mistakes and live better. He spends a life pursuing wealth. He spends a life prioritizing family. He spends a life of hedonism and apathy. Each attempt reveals truths about living... how each pursuit creates tradeoffs and how our decisions often have unintended consequences. It's a book that provides an entertaining story and a lot to reflect on when the story ends (especially if you're going through a mid-life crisis, which I am definitely, probably, hopefully not).

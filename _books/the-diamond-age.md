This is a story set in a future where nano-technology has enabled a post-scarcity society. In this world, everybody has access to a matter compilerâ€”basically a 3D printer where you select whatever you need from a menu and it'll print it (food, clothing, a mattress, etc). You would think this abundance would result in peace and prosperity but instead we find a society of illiteracy, crime, and tribalism. It's a fascinating juxtaposition and one I was excited to explore. While I enjoyed much of the story, I struggled to keep track of all the politics, which ended up being pretty central to the story. There were a lot of tribes, locations, and people, and the book wasn't very explicit on their roles, which left me wondering who was rebelling against who (and why). I suspect everything would be easier to follow on a second read-through. Regardless, the book was still interesting. I always like stories about technology and its impact on society.

This book follows the story of a group of Moon colonists (Lunies) who stage a political revolution and declare independence from the earthly governments ruling over them. The story was set on the Moon but the book was more political fiction than science fiction. It often went into great detail about political strategy and diplomacy, which wasn't that interesting to me. They explored what a Moon society might look like, but it felt a bit hit or miss. The family structures were confusing, and the idea of the Moon being better for farming than Earth felt laughable. I did however, enjoy Mike (the supercomputer character) and how his capabilities guided the story.

I added this book to my list years ago, mostly because I have heard people quote it and I enjoyed Lewis's other Christian-themed book, "The Screwtape Letters." Apparently, "Mere Christianity" is based on a series of radio broadcasts that C.S. Lewis gave, explaining the fundamentals of Christianity. He approaches the topic as an intellectual which really appealed to me. For example, the first part of the book builds up a case for the existence of God from first principles (starting with universally recognized ideas of right and wrong). From there, he describes how Christianity provides a framework for personal transformation. Throughout the book, the explanations were accessible and fairly self-evident (unlike a lot of religious content that demands faith up-front). Some parts were a bit dated but overall it felt like a good primer, especially for the educated and skeptical.

This book is a memoir about J.D. Vance's experience growing up in Middletown Ohio. Vance's childhood was notable in that he was raised in a poor household by his mother and grandparents, who were hillbilly immigrants from Kentucky. J.D.'s experiences highlight a culture-clash between the hillbilly people and modern society. His people often suffer from addiction, broken families, chronic unemployment, poor health outcomes, and a host of other issues. The book discussed questions like "who is responsible for these bad outcomes", and "what does it take for a person to overcome them." Overall, I found the story interesting. I liked how it shined a light on a world that felt foreign despite being in my own backyard.

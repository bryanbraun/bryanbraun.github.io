In this book, Clayton Christensen (and his co-authors) take the business management principles that he's developed over his career as a professor at Harvard Business School, and uses them as a lens for making life decisions. Early in the book, Clayton describes how several people in his HBS graduating class had achieved great salaries and titles over the years, but suffered from a series of failed relationships, or even ended up in prison. As a result, Clayton's advice centers around helping people find meaningful work, build strong family relationships, and live with integrity. It was one of those books where as I was listening to it, I thought "I should be taking notes!" I was particularly impacted by the parts about investing in your children by creating a strong family culture. Overall, a very important book (especially for working parents), and one I hope to revisit in the future.

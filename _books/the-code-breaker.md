This book is part biography of Jennifer Doudna (the Nobel Prize winning biochemist), and part history of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technology (which has undergone rapid development over the past 10 years). The book dives into the world of biochemistry research, giving a play-by-play description of how CRISPR has developed, from the papers, to the patent wars, to the companies created to apply the technology. It's a long book about a recent (and unfinished) topic, so while it felt excessively detailed at times, it also gave me a sense of awe at the biochemistry frontier that is just now opening before us. A nice book for the curious (and especially for students with an interest in doing biochemistry research).

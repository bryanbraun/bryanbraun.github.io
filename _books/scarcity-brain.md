Scarcity Brain is a book about the challenges of living in a world of abundance with a brain that's adapted to living in a world of scarcity. The author, Michael Easter, argues that our reward pathways were optimized to forage for food, an activity full of anticipation and unpredictable rewards. Much of our modern day entertainment hijacks those reward pathways, resulting in compulsive use that hurts our physical and mental health. Easter calls this cycle "The Scarcity Loop" and shows how it's behind a surprising number of our modern problems, including gambling addiction, cardiovascular disease, and overconsumption in all of it's various forms (doomscrolling, retail therapy, alcoholism, etc). To understand how to break this cycle, Easter spends time living with a tribe in the Amazon, Benedictine Monks, and wilderness survival experts, to see what he can learn. I was hoping the book would address modern hangups around time scarcity and money scarcity, but overall I liked the topic and found it engaging throughout. I especially enjoyed the part about the history of slot machines. Recommended!

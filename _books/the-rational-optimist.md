This is a book about the history of human prosperity. The books starts with ancient humans and walks forward in time, describing the breakthroughs that advanced human civilization. Some of these things were technologies (cooking, writing, the internet, etc), but the author really focused on practices like free exchange, specialization, and cultural evolution. The optimism comes from looking at the big pictureâ€”life for humans is much better today than it has ever been in the past and we have every reason to believe that it will continue to improve. There are a lot of people out there who [get caught in a bubble of doom](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/dont-be-a-doomer) and have no idea that our current problems are just the latest in a series of crises that humans overcame. It's easy to say "this time it's different," but this book gives you the evidence you need to believe otherwise.

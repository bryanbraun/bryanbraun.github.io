After recently watching [A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Day_in_the_Neighborhood) I was left with the thought that the world would be a better place if more people were like Mr. Rogers. This book, Nonviolent Communication, essentially teaches you how to do that... to become like Mr. Rogers. It centers around communicating in a way that identifies your feelings, expresses your needs, and authentically recognizes the feelings and needs of others. At first I was afraid that a book about communicating your feelings would be boring, but the writing was focused and relied heavily on stories and examples which kept me engaged. Most importantly, it opened my eyes to how badly I typically communicate... how often I respond thoughtlessly, my words laced with judgments and evaluations. It was an important wake-up call and one everyone should experience.

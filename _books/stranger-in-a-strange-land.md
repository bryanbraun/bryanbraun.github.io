Written in 1961, this book is the first "classic Sci-Fi" book I've ever read. It tells the story of Valentine Michael Smith, a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars and raised by Martians (fun fact: this was actually a plausible scenario when the book was writtenâ€”speculation about intelligent life on Mars was common until 1965, when the Mariner 4 probe took the first ever close-up images of the planet). Anyways, the story follows Smith as he faces challenges trying to adapt to human society. The book had good parts, but it ended up being more social science than science fiction, which was kind of a bummer. When it ended, it felt like I had read a cultural commentary on monogamy. Definitely not what I was expecting, but interesting nonetheless.

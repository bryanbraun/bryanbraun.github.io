This is a book about reframing. It shows you how to change how you think about something and choose a perspective that is **useful** to you. The key is the word useful. So often we say that we seek "truth." It's a noble pursuit! But shockingly few things meet a strict definition of true. Memories are inaccurate. The past is interpreted. Science itself is series of models that are continually superseded by better ones. Even a question like "what time is it?" has no "true" answer because *it depends on where you are*. If we only pursued what was strictly true, we'd have very little to build a life around. It's better to pursue what is **useful**. Beliefs can be useful when they cause us to take the actions that we want to embody. We can intentionally adopt useful beliefs and *reframing* is how we do it. This book is fairly cerebral (thinking about thinking!) so it's probably not for everyone but I found it very empowering.

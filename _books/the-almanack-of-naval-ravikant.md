This book is a collection of thoughts and writings from Naval Ravikant, mostly sourced from his interviews and social media posts. Naval is a startup founder and venture capitalist in Silicon Valley who's known for his original and concise advice about wealth and happiness. The book is organized into aphorisms, with expanded thoughts below each one (a good format for a book, though it's a little tricky to follow via audiobook). The book was short but felt like it was packed with wisdom. You could learn a lot by going through it slowly and reflecting on each point. This feels like a good one to re-read from time to time.

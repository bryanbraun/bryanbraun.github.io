In this book, Sal Khan (the founder of Khan Academy) does two things. First, he tells the story of Khan Academy, how it grew from a collection of math lessons on YouTube to an ambitious online platform for self-paced learning. Second, he lays out his vision for the future of education, calling out the flaws he sees in the current system, and the ways we can use technology to build something better. Despite this book being thirteen years old now, I still found his vision fresh and compelling. As a product, Khan Academy has made a big impact in my household, and reading this book helped me see how much of the product is a result of Sal's vision. I'm excited to see what Sal and Khan Academy do next.

I enjoyed reading "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" out loud to my kids, so I wanted to follow it up with the sequel. Like the original, the winding plot is unremarkable but that's ok because it serves as the delivery vehicle for Adams's trademarked humorous digressions. He explains time travel, the origin of man, and galactic politics, as only Douglas Adams can: with unfailing logic leading to complete absurdity. Also, Marvin really shines in this book. His misfortune of being left behind when the crew travelled billions of years into future is one of the funniest set-ups in fiction... one of the few moments that stuck with me 20 years after my first read of the book. Overall, a fun read, and just as good as the original.

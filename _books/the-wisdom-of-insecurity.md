Alan Watts was a philosopher who became known for books and lectures he produced in the 1950s which blended eastern philosophy with western religion. This book, The Wisdom of Insecurity, explain the causes of "Insecurity" (which today, we might call anxiety), the role it plays in our lives, and how we can overcome it. The discussion is wide-ranging, addressing topics like human desire, self-awareness, faith vs skepticism, science vs religion, and finding meaning in life. A key theme is the Law of Reversed Effort, which is often described in analogies: When you try to stay on the surface of the water, you sink; but when you try to sink you float. Or another: when you hold your breath you lose your breath. This idea applies to anxiety in that it's our efforts to obtain security that results in the insecurity we feel daily (this was also touched on in Pixar's "Inside Out 2"). I enjoyed the topic and found resonance in many of his other ideas (especially his thinking around science and religion). For a taste of his thinking, see excerpts of his speeches [in this whiteboard video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBpaUICxEhk) or [this game trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYHp8LwBUzo).

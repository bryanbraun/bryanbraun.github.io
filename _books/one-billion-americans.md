For those who follow global politics, the last several years have been full of discussion about the rise of China and projected decline of American influence. In this book, Matthew Yglesias argues that America needs to position itself as a counterbalance to China and that the way to do it is to grow its population to *1 Billion Americans*. It's a wild idea, but Yglesias makes the case that such a focused and ambitious national goal would push the country to work out solutions to longstanding problems, like reforming immigration, better supporting families, and improving transportation and housing. I don't typically read these kinds of books but the audacity of its ideas was refreshing and the book was well-written. Very interesting and unconventional to be sure.

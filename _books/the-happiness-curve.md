In this book, Jonathan Rauch describes an unusual finding by happiness researchers: on average, people's self-rated happiness over their lifetimes creates a U-shaped curve (with the lowest happiness rating occurring in the middle of life). This finding transcends nations, cultures, and even species. What's more, it persists when controlling for education, gender, wealth, or other likely factors. The book synthesizes research and personal interviews to find common symptoms (like feeling unaccomplished or ungrateful), possible causes (like a values shift or grappling with the constraints of mortality), and potential solutions (like finding peer groups and coaching). I especially enjoyed Rauch's references to [the Voyage of Life paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voyage_of_Life) (which I looked up online but somehow missed when visiting the National Gallery of Art). Despite not being this book's target audience, I found it eye-opening and strangely reassuring. Bad times are coming but good times are coming too.

Steven Harper was one of my favorite college professors so when I heard that he wrote this book, I wanted to give it a read. The book is targeted towards members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and it assumes a fair amount of pre-existing knowledge. It covers a period of LDS church history where the people tried various forms of communal living, including "The Family," the United Order, and the Law of Consecration. It was a short bookâ€”I actually found myself wishing it was a bit longer, with more selections included from the Doctrine and Covenants. It was a good mix of interesting history and relevant principles for church members today.

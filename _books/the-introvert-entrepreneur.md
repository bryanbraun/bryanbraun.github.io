This is a book about how to cope and thrive as an Introvert Entrepreneur. It took a while for me to warm up to it... I struggled to identify with its stereotype of an introvert and its stereotype of an entrepreneur ([Ha ha! Business!](https://haha.business)). The book was at its strongest when it deep-dived on strategies for introverts in common small-business situations, like sales, networking, and public speaking. It made me realize that by reframing these activities in terms of your strengths, you see all sorts of ways that introvert tendencies are an incredible advantage. For example, strong listening skills and non-superficial 1-on-1 interactions results in great networking. [The Obstacle is the Way]({{site.url}}/books/#the-obstacle-is-the-way)!

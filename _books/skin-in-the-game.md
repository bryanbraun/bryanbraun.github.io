The big idea in this book is that people produce results when they are held accountable (aka. when they have "skin in the game"). He then shows how some professions consistanly deliver value because this accountability is structurally built into them, while others, lacking accountability, are plauged with superficiality. In business, a company that fails to please it's customers dies. Conversely, a macroeconomist's theories can't be proven true or false, so their career becomes a game of persuasion and politics (which produces little external value). Then, in classic Taleb fashion, he uses these points as ammuntion for an epic rant where he lambasts journalists, academics, researchers, politicians, economists, gender studies majors, and pretty much anybody else who doesn't meet his standard for statistical rigor. He blows right past passive-agressive to full-on agressive. It's not quite my style but I enjoyed the ideas he shared along the way.

The big idea in this book is that people produce results when they are held accountable (aka. when they have "skin in the game"). Taleb then explains how some professions consistently deliver value because this accountability is structurally built into them, while others, lacking accountability, are plagued with superficiality. In business, a company that fails to please it's customers dies. Conversely, a macroeconomist's theories can't be proven true or false, so their career becomes a game of persuasion and politics (which produces little external value). Then, in classic Taleb fashion, he uses these points as ammunition for an epic rant where he lambasts journalists, academics, researchers, politicians, economists, gender studies majors, and pretty much anybody else who doesn't meet his standard for statistical rigor. He blows right past passive-aggressive to full-on aggressive. It's not quite my style but I enjoyed the ideas he shared along the way.

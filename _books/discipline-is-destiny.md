This is a book about temperance and discipline. Like Holiday's other books, it pulls lots of examples from athletes, historical figures, and stoicism. And like his other books, this one found me at the perfect time, when I needed more discipline in my eating habits, my job, and my social life. I found myself applying it immediately. For example, one evening I decided to play a computer game once I finished the dishes, but because I turned on the audiobook while washing, I was able to summon the discipline to skip the game and tackle my to-dos instead. I hit inbox-zero for the first time in 6 months because of this book! I especially liked the sections on financial discipline and overcoming the body. While the book didn't feel as tight or punchy as some of his other books, it changed my behavior and that's a big deal. Definitely a good one to re-read periodically.

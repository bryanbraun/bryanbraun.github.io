Anthem is a story set in a dystopian future where technology has regressed, standards of living have fallen, and people's lives are micromanaged by an oppressive government. The story follows a street-sweeper who illegally pursues an interest in science, which leads him to discover the fallen state of his society. Like most dystopian political commentary, the scenarios are somewhat contrived, but it had some interesting features like the coded names, the prohibition of privacy, and the role of the word "I." Even with the inevitable character monologue at the end, the book was quick and focused (which I appreciated). I'd say it's a good option for someone who wants to try reading something of Rand's without becoming mired in a never-ending mega-novel.

This is a biography on the political life of Mitt Romney. The book describes Romney's journey to each of his political roles, from governor of Massachusetts to US Presidential candidate to US Senator (Utah). Along the way, the author focuses on Romney's internal struggles as he tries to hold to his principles in the face of increasing political polarization and authoritarianism in his own party. The book gives an unfiltered view of the people and processes in the US Senate (including some unflattering portrayals of several current politicians), which added entertainment value. Overall, I came away with increasing respect for Romney because of his integrity and loyalty to country (over party).

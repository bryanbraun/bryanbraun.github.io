This book looks at the technologies we see in science fiction and asks the question, "are these impossible?" To answer the question, the author evaluates each technology under the currently known laws of physics, sorting them into one of three categories: Class 1 impossibilities (do not violate the known laws of physics), class 2 impossibilities (possible in theory, but incredibly speculative), and class 3 impossibilities (violate the known laws of physics). These evaluations are very technical, diving into topics like energy physics, relativity, and multi-dimensional string theory. I loved it. I especially enjoyed it when my intuition was wrong (like how time-travel and multiverse hopping were more possible than perpetual motion machines or future-seeing). This book is a must-read for anyone who appreciates science-fiction and physics.

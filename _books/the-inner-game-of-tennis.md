This book is a guide on how to improve your Tennis performance by mastering something the author calls "the inner game." The inner game is all about trusting your body to know what to do and not letting your mind get in the way. In modern terms, it's learning how to get into a "flow state" and keep yourself there. I don't play Tennis but the concepts felt relevant to my own interests (like piano and weightlifting) so I found myself taking all sorts of notes. The author did a great job of bringing the ideas to life using stories from his coaching practice. I was especially interested in the parts about overcoming nervousness and non-judgemental observation. A classic book and still relevant today.

Science *should* be fascinating but modern textbooks somehow find a way to suck all the curiosity and fun out of it. At least that's what Bill Bryson thinks, and this book is his attempt to write something better. In many ways, he succeeds. The book is approachable and occasionally entertaining as it hops from one scientific discipline to the other, explaining everything from the big bang to particle physics. Bill's secret sauce is summarizing the topic, extracting out the interesting questions, and highlighting any sources of potential humor (the wittier the better, as Bill Bryson would). I would occasionally get tired of him walking down the timeline of influential scientists in a field, but overall it felt interesting enough to be worth a solid recommendation.

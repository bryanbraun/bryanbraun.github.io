This was a collection of stories from the life of Richard P. Feynman, the famous educator and Nobel prize winning Physicist. The stories don't teach you much about physics or share any life lessons. Rather, they give you an idea of Feynman's life and character... and he was quite the character. He's impish, opinionated, and brash, constantly playing practical jokes, pursuing his interests, and chasing women. The book was entertaining at times but ended up feeling like empty calories.

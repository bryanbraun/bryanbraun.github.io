This is a story about two childhood friends who decide to make a video game together, kicking off a journey of ambition, conflict, success, and failure. My favorite parts were about the game-making. The drive to create something novel and worthy of your expectations. The forces of compromise, criticism, and luck. The details of the creative-struggle. The games themselves were clever and I found myself impressed with the author for inventing them in the detail she did. Ultimately though, this book was more about relationships and interpersonal conflict. I liked these parts less. The characters were flawed, often petty and immature, hungry for recognition, and willing to hold grudges. Still, the plot grabbed my attention and made for a enjoyable read.

In ancient Greece, there were various schools (Stoics, Epicurians, Hedonists, etc.) each offering their own philosophy for how to live your life. This book is the closest thing I've found to a modern version of that. Each of the 27 short chapters makes an different argument for the right way to live. One chapter says "Pursue Learning". Another says "Pursue Wealth." One says to chase the future while another says to live in the present. The chapters blatantly contradict each other, and while your instinct is to ask, "so which one's right?" the book's ending gives you a better way to look at it (I won't give it away!). I ended up buying the ebook and reading it slowly over the course of several months, taking dozens of pages of notes along the way. I felt like I was trying on each philosophy like an article of clothing to see how it fits. It was a lovely exercise, and one I'd recommend to anyone.

This was one of the first books on my booklist and I finally got around to reading it (it was a Dave Ramsey recommendation 10+ years ago). The book is about improving your life by setting boundaries in your relationships, (all of your relationships, including you/spouse, you/child, you/parent, and you/friend). It was written by a psychologist but the text is so heavily Christian-influenced that it almost felt like a sermon (especially how it used scripture references to support its assertions). I was skeptical about the Christian framing at first but it ended up adding value to the book, because the fact is that people often use Christian principles (like meekness, humility, charity, obedience, "turning the other cheek," etc.) to justify boundary problems. The book helps you navigate those issues and clearly see where your personal boundaries actually lie. It turned out to be surprisingly tangible: you control what you do and others control what they do. I especially appreciated all of the example conflicts, which made the principles a lot more clear. Overall, the book was a lot less boring and more helpful than I expected it to be.

This was a science-fiction story set in a future where humans are just one of many known lifeforms in the Milky-Way galaxy. The story is about a cancerous advanced life-form (named "the blight") that is accidentally released into the galaxy, and the humans who attempt to stop it. It isn't a short book and it took a while for me to get enough context to get pulled into the story, but it ended up being worth it. I loved the idea of a galaxy divided into regions of different physical properties, like the Transcend, which supports faster-than-light interactions. Such places support the existence of advanced, super-intelligent life-forms ("powers") whose dealings are beyond human comprehension. It's like something out of a Lovecraft story and I dig it (even if it ended up feeling a bit too magical for my taste).

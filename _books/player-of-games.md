I listened to this as an audiobook because I needed something entertaining to pass the time during a long road trip. It's a science-fiction story set in a far-future human society about a game-player who gets recruited to play games with a newly contacted alien species. The premise was interesting and the storyline felt easier to follow than "Consider Phlebas" (the only other book I've read in the series). The story had "Ender's Game" vibes, which I appreciated. Overall, a nice way to pass the time in the car.

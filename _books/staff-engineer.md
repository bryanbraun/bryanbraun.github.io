Thus far in my software dev career, I've preferred "individual contributor" (IC) roles over management roles. In many companies, there's this idea of an IC track, parallel to the management track, where an engineer can advance in their skills and impact. In these companies, at the top of the IC track, there's a role called "Staff Engineer." That role is the topic of this book. From what I could tell reading this book, Staff Engineers tend to only exist at larger companies because their work often involves using context and expertise to solve cross-cutting problems. The responsibilities of Staff Engineers vary widely from company to company but it's always about using your technical expertise to drive business impact. The book attempts to find commonalities in the role across companies and teach to those topics, but I felt like those chapters fell flat. I learned a lot more from the series of interviews with Staff Engineers that were printed verbatim in the second half of the book. In fact, you could cut everything but the interviews, and I think the book would be just as good (if not better).

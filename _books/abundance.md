In this book, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson argue that the US needs to do a better job at building stuff, if it's going to rise to the challenges of the future (climate change, cost-of-living increases, competition from China, etc). What kind of stuff do we need to build? Housing, green energy, transmission lines, safe AI, advanced medicine, and various other forms of infrastructure. Throughout the book, the authors dig into why we've gotten so bad at building these kinds of things and what we might do to turn it around. I liked the case-study of the I-95 overpass in Philadelphia being successfully rebuilt in 12 days, and what made it an outlier. I also enjoyed the chapters on innovation, including this killer quote: *"Generations from now, inventions that we can scarcely imagine will feel core to modern life... If these things are possible in the realm of physical reality, then they are possible to discoverâ€”and if they can be discovered in a century, they can be discovered in a decade. Or in a year."* The book felt important, pragmatic, and focused on all the right things. Let's go do it!

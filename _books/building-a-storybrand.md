This book is about how to effectively talk to customers about your products (a surprisingly difficult thing to do well). To do this, we need to understand how stories work. All good stories have a familiar arc: a hero in pusuit of a goal encounters obstacles along the way until they meet *a guide* who helps them overcome the obstacles and reach their destination. Everyone, including our customers, sees themselves as the hero of their own story. So to get their attention, we have to think about how we fit into the customer's story, and position ourselves as the guide that will help them reach their goals. It's a clever analogy and a great framework for seeing the world from the customer's perspective. It really felt foundational.

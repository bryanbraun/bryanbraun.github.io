This story follows a handful of scientists and physicists as they make a world-changing discovery, ushering in a period of energy abundance. But while some researchers embrace the new discoveries (and the recognition that comes with them), others start raising concerns that the new technologies put humanity at risk. Who is right, and who is motivated by ego and pride? This was my first time reading Isaac Asimov, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it felt modern, fresh, and weirdly realistic (for a story about free energy). Yes, it's science-fiction, but ultimately it's a story about how the desire for recognition creates incentives that may not align with truth-seeking. Maybe I'll read more Asimov in the future.

In this book, Doctor Anna Lembke discusses the prevalence of dopamine-based addiction in our modern society. The book focuses on the stories of dozens of Anna's patients, each one dealing with addiction in some form (yes, drugs and alcohol, but also romance novels, food, sex, pain, and more). The sheer diversity of the addictions helped broaden my understanding of what addiction is. We really have to watch ourselves for signs of compulsive use of *anything* as a coping strategy, lest it become destructive. I liked her break-down of the efficacy of Alcoholics Anonymous, as it brought up interesting parallels with religious groups that have similar practices around abstinence. I also liked her perspective on self-binding, pro-social shame, and radical honestyâ€”again, all practices that are woven into many religious traditions. The book was like a secular argument for the unpopular, but healthy, practices that we all need when fighting [the modern struggle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqlfWDyS1Io). Important book!

Cloud Atlas is something like a set of loosely connected short stories nested inside of each other. The stories are about as different from each other as can be. While they're all fiction, they follow different characters in different times, using different narrative styles and genres. One moment you're reading a series of letters from an early 1900s British composer, and then suddenly you're in a murder mystery novel. It's pretty disorienting (the first time the story switched, I thought my audiobook file was corrupted) but I started to get used to it. The book ended without tying things together clearly which made me think it was the kind of book that needed multiple readings to fully appreciate. It certainly felt like an author experimenting with the medium in a way that's impressive to other authors (given the awards the book has received) without quite nailing the landing for mainstream readers. Interesting nonetheless!

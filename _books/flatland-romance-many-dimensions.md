If you are the kind of person who finds math interesting and likes the experience of having your mind expanded and warped (I suspect there aren't too many of us out there), then you'll love this book. It's a short, playful, story of a world where the inhabitants are all shapes living on a two dimensional plane. Throughout the story, the 3D reader begins to effectively understand the perspective of a 2D shape. The experience of hopping through worlds of various dimensions actually teaches mathematic principles leading up to extrapolating out concepts of higher dimensional planes. It's incredible that such concepts can be taught in such a short and simple book. Brilliant. By the way, the book is not a romance in the modern sense and it is in the public domain.

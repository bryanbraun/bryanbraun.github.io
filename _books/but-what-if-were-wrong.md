I listened to the audiobook, which is basically 10 hours of Chuck Klosterman working his way through every category of popular culture, pontificating for a while, and then taking a contrarian viewpoint about what it's going to look like in the future. He focuses a lot on trends in music, art, literature, and sports... squishy topics where nothing can really be disproven. He does talk about physics, which I found interesting, but it was a pretty light pass that leans heavily on some interviews he did. The audiobook made me feel like I was in a college dorm listening to an annoying philosophy student argue about things that don't matter. It was self-indulgent. Think Nassim Taleb, without the insights. Pass.

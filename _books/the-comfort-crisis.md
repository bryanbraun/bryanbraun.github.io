This book argues that the comfort of our modern lives is the source of many of our problems today. The book's narrative is built around a challenge that the author (Michael Easter) undertook to survive in the arctic for 30+ days. Throughout the story, Easter describes the impact of our modern environment on our minds and our bodies, including lots of good research and expert opinion. He gave words to some concepts I had believed but not articulated, like "comfort creep," where we adapt to yesterday's comforts until they become unacceptable (similar to lifestyle creep), and "problem creep," where we regularly lower our threshold for what constitutes a problem. This is how we become, as George Bernard Shaw says, *"a feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that life will not devote itself to making you happy."* The book covers many lifestyle topics, like physical activity, eating, boredom, sleep, and our modern exposure to nature, hunger, noise, and death. Some of Easter's solutions included undertaking deliberate challenges (Misogis), gratitude, and designing more workflows into our lives that our bodies are better adapted for (more exposure to nature, more quiet, more boredom, more hunger, and more daily, functional, physical activity). There's lots of overlap with Stoicism. It feels like a book that everyone should read!

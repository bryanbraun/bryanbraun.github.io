This book describes a world where the US Apollo 8 mission to the moon collides with the crystal sphere surrounding the earth, cracking it, and causing the fundamental laws that govern the physical world to start breaking down. This process also restores previously-hidden fundamental laws, based not on mathematics, but on *divine light*. It's a world where angels exist, divine utterances act as powerful incantations, and kabbalistic biblical interpretations can accurately describe physical reality. This world is absurd in all the best ways. The characters engage in philosophic debates, entire storylines are created to set up a pun, and ridiculous things are taken seriously because THERE ARE NO COINCIDENCES. While you can [read the book online](https://unsongbook.com/), I recommend the audiobook (found in [this podcast feed](https://unsong.libsyn.com/)) because the production quality was ðŸ‘Œ. The book feels best suited for someone who is both logically-minded and religious (ideally, Jewish), so I can't speak for anyone else, but it was working for me. It's unlike anything I've ever read.

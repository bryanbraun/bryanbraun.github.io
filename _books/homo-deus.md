This was an uncomfortable read. Yuval is brilliant at what he does, but what he does in this book is dispassionately deconstruct every modern framework and philosophy held by humanity. Nothing is spared: religion, liberalism (which he considers a religion), capitalism, individualism, human rights, and more. For one example, he takes Humanism (this idea that Humans are fundamentally different than other animals) demonstrates how foundational it is to human society, dissects it's assumptions, and then describes how technical advances over time will increasingly expose it as a convenient myth. In his vision, our evolutionary history will drive us to pursue immortality and happiness, but not only will we fall short of both goals, we will undermine our belief systems one by one until we are circumvented by the algorithms we've created to serve us, and end up a passing ripple in the cosmic data flow. Oof.

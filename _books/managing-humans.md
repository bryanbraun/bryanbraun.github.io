This book is basically a collection of blog posts from "Rands in Repose" a popular blog by Michael Lopp (Rands) on Engineering Management. It covers a variety of topics like meetings, hiring, and company reorganizations, all written in a jokey-casual tone from a early 2000's Silicon Valley perspective. Rands leans on stereotypes a lot, often coining new terms for the types of people and situations he encountered, though it was usually good-natured. I didn't really connect with the writing style, and it was hard to tell how relevant the advice was to me, but I found a few of the stories entertaining.

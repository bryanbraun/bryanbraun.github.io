This book is about how we can use stories to share our beliefs and values with loved ones. In one way, the book serves as a memoir, with the author, Steve Mann, sharing his own stories and the values they contain. In another way, the book is a workbook, helping you, the reader, identify stories that represent your own values. Steve was my mission president from 2007-2008 and I enjoyed learning more about his life and experiences from the stories. I didn't get as much value from the workbook part but maybe I'd find it more useful at a different phase in my life.

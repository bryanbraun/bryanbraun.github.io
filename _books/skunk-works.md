This book tells the story of the Skunk Works, the famous division of Lockheed-Martin that designed and built top-secret high-performance military aircraft for the US Government. Many famous military planes came out of the Skunk Works, like the U-2 spy plane, F-117 Nighthawk, and the SR-71 Blackbird. The book goes into great detail describing the development of each of these planes and many others. The stories were pretty incredible, like the challenges they had to overcome in designing the first ever titanium airplane. I knew the SR-71 was impressive before but this book made me realize how ridiculous it really was. The book also gave me a peek into the military industrial complex which gave me a bit more empathy for that world. A fun and interesting read, particularly for the engineering-minded.

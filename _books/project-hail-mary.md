Project Hail Mary is a "hard science-fiction" story, set in the present day, about a last-ditch effort to save humanity. I don't want to say much else for fear of giving away parts of the plot that are much better discovered. Discovery is a big theme of this book. You, the reader, get taken along on a journey of discovery, joining Dr. Grace as he uses physics and biology to piece together evidences and find solutions to problems. If you liked "The Martian" (written by the same author) then you'll love this. I certainly did.

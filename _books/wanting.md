What we want is at the root of all of our decisions. So why do we want what we want? To answer that question, this book explores the ideas of the late literary philosopher René Girard, who taught that much of our desire is mimetic. To explain, our wanting often comes from models—people we use as a reference for ourselves. These could be role models (who we want to be like) or rivals (who we don't want to be like). We can easily get swept away in mimetic cycles (like competition or mob behavior), where our desires spiral out of control. This isn't ideal, since it often leads to violence or other regrettable outcomes. The book offers some ideas on how to identify our true ("thick") desires and pursue them intentionally, for a more satisfying life. Overall, the topic was interesting and approachable. A good tool for increasing your self-awareness.

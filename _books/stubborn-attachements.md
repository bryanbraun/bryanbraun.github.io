I picked this up because I wanted to read something by Tyler Cowen and it was highly rated. I don't know what I was expecting, but this wasn't it. Listening to the audiobook felt like I was taking a 400-level philosophy class on economic growth. It spent a lot of time building an ethical and philosophical framework for growth, making the argument internally consistent, and discussing hypothetical edge-cases. Some interesting concepts emerged like the trade-off between present individual rights and future prosperity. I also liked the discussion around "Crusonia Plants" and Derek Parfitâ€™s "Repugnant Conclusion." That being said, most of the book felt like an attempt to persuade a certain type of person... like a philosopher who was morally opposed to economic growth. I'm not that person, so it didn't end up doing much for me.

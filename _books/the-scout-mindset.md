This book is a defense of using truth-seeking as your north-star principle in life. A lot of people seem to value truth-seeking until they find themselves in a situation where the truth challenges their ego, identity, or income stream. To explain this, the author describes two possible mindsets: The Soldier Mindset (which seeks to protect you), and the Scout Mindset (which seeks to see reality clearly). The Scout Mindset (which she advocates) is flexible, willing to pursue the truth wherever it leads. Instead of assuming that the value of truth is self-evident, the book evaluates several arguments *against* maximal truth-seeking (like, "irrational self-belief results in better outcomes," and "prioritizing truth-seeking sacrifices happiness"). She made a strong case! I liked her examples of Solider Mindset "ripple effects," which helped me see its unseen costs. The discussion of "can I believe this" vs "must I believe this" clicked with me as well. I suspect that I'll be thinking about this book for awhile.

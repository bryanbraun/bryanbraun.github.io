I've enjoyed a lot of Malcolm Gladwell's work (both his books and his podcast), so when I heard he had a new book, I checked it out. It was a little different than his other books. It wasn't really a "journey through the overlooked and the misunderstood." It was more like "Malcolm Gladwell's take on several of the most controversial news stories that ran over the last 5-10 years" (think, Bernie Madoff, Jerry Sandusky, Brock Turner, and Sandra Bland). That's not necessarily a bad thing. His take is nuanced, and it connects these stories in interesting ways (specifically, how they all rely on people failing to accurately assess strangers). But personally, I'm not really interested in disecting the news. I found a few interesting ideas, like "default to truth" (and its consequences). Also, the format of the audiobook was similar to his podcast, which was unexpected and kind of amazing. But at the end of the day, it wasn't a good fit for me.

This is the third and final book in the "Three Body Problem" series (also called, ["Remembrance of Earth's Past"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_of_Earth%27s_Past)), by Chinese science fiction author Cixin Liu. The story follows humanity, navigating a cold-war existence with other alien lifeforms in a hostile universe. The story timeline jumps around a lot (thanks to hibernation technology and time dilation), which made it feel like five science-fiction books in one. Like the other books in the series, this one is packed with technology, philosophy, and periods of utter despair. The storyline was so baffling that I'd often find myself in disbelief, needing to share details with my family members. While the book had flaws (it was often disorienting and I had a hard time connecting with the characters), it was incredibly ambitious and a worthy conclusion to the series.

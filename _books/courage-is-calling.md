This is a book about courage. I started reading it just because it "was there," but it really drew me in. It had inspiring stories of people who took a stand and overcame great odds, but more than that, it forced me to look at myself. It made me want to be more courageous. Not just to stand up to threats, but to have uncomfortable conversations, to push to improve things at work when it's easier to stay quiet, to keep working on myself, over and over, even when it's difficult to see progress. The last chapter in particular felt important, breaking "the fourth wall," a demonstration of courage in itself. I couldn't help but think, "this is the book that the world needs right now."

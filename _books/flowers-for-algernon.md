Flowers for Algernon (1959) is a fictional story about Charlie, a mentally handicapped man who undergoes an experimental medical procedure to make him smarter. The story is told through a series of journal entries, written by Charlie himself (for research purposes). There was strong foreshadowing throughout the book, which gave me with this feeling of dread, like I was watching a train wreck in slow motion. Charlie's progression gives you a lot of things to chew on. The world can be a cruel place, even when it's nobody's fault. We're all handicapped in various ways and we often hurt each other without even realizing it. Intelligence is a double-edged sword; ignorance can be bliss. The storyline itself was a whirlwind of human social dynamics and perhaps even an allegory for the journey we all take through life. Wow.

This was like a post-modern productivity book. Where a typical productivity book might give you tips on how to work efficiently, this book asks, "What's the point of working more efficiently, if you'll just be rewarded with more work?" In this way, it was more a philosophy book, asking the big questions behind our productivity obsession. True to it's subtitle ("Time Management for Mortals"), the book described how our time-management behaviors are a byproduct of how we grapple with "finitude," the reality that we are mortals with finite lifespans, that could end at any moment. It was honestly a very refreshing take on the topic.

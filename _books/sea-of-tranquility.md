This is a fairly short science-fiction story about the investigation of a mysterious supernatural event. It had everything: good characters, interesting science, moral dilemmas... I loved it! It did some narrative jumping, like Cloud Atlas, but unlike Cloud Atlas, it did a great job of connecting all the stories together. I expect that I'll be recommending it a lot in the future (especially because it was very approachable for science-fiction).

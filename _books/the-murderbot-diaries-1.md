This book is the first in a science-fiction series where the main character is a humanoid security robot ("murderbot"), that has gone rogue. By "gone rogue", I mean, it overrode it's own governance systems without it's employer knowing, so now it has to pretend like it's functioning normally, while trying to figure out what it wants to do with it's new-found freedom. It's a neat premise, but it's the robot's personality that really makes it shine. The robot is neurotic, insecure, and addicted to TV shows... basically a weaponized bodyguard with the emotional maturity of a teenager. I burned through [the audiobook](https://www.graphicaudio.net/the-murderbot-diaries-1-all-systems-red.html?srsltid=AfmBOor_s4Nev-bQSoOOTjBCX9R55d25X9OvyLbTGbGUwkSkTpi0AoSs) in one shot (it's super short) and found it very entertaining.

"Will" is an memoir on the life of Will Smith, written by Will Smith and his co-author Mark Manson. The book walks through Will's life, including his childhood struggles and rise to stardom, with frequent digressions to reflect on lessons learned (the chapters have names like "Fear," "Hope," and "Purpose"). Its good material, but to get the full effect you have to do the audiobook. Will Smith himself is the narrator and he's in full entertainment mode, laughing, yelling, building anticipation, and putting on a performance. He often pulls in music and audio samples, which creates some great moments along the way. My main criticism is that the book felt a bit premature (like [the Elon Musk biography]({{site.url}}/books/#elon-musk-tesla-spacex-and-the-quest-for-a-fantastic-future)). I would have loved to hear more about "the slap," his National Geographic series, and other ongoing projects. There were some uncomfortable moments here and there but overall it was a fun and entertaining experience.

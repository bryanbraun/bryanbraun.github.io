This short story is part science-fiction, part horror. It's about a AI that goes rogue and tortures the humans that created it. Very disturbing. It felt like the AI was right out of a Lovecraft storyâ€”alien and incomprehensible. It reminded me of ["Shoggoths with a Smiley Face"](https://crookedtimber.org/2023/07/03/shoggoths-amongst-us/) (specifically, that unforgettable image). It's hard to believe this was written in 1967.

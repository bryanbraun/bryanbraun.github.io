This book gives a history of the personal computer, with a focus on the people and culture who brought it into the world. I was familiar with several of the stories (from the Steve Jobs biography) but there was a lot more to the computer revolution besides Apple. I especially enjoyed learning about the early days, where amateur tinkerers spun up magazines, clubs, conferences, and companies, all for the sake of experimenting and sharing information. The world wasn't always just Macs and PCs, and it was interesting to learn more about how we got this place.

This is an older science fiction book I heard about from a friend. In the story, George Orr finds himself with the ability to change reality based on what he dreams. Unable to control the power, he attempts to suppress it and eventually finds himself in the care of a sleep psychologist (Dr. Haber). With time and research, Dr. Haber learns how to control George's dreams, but wielding the power to alter reality can have harmful consequences (as you can imagine). The story raises some interesting questions. Is utopia possible? Is one person's utopia invariably another person's dystopia, because of our differing values? As a society, what are we working towards (and will we like it when we get there)? I like how Dr. Haber is a complex antagonist. He clearly wants to do what is right and his actions can be justified nearly every step of the way. His accumulation of power is for the purpose of advancing knowledge and addressing the world's problems, right? It's only when you look at the big picture that it all feels off. I'm not sure how I feel about the book's ending but there was a lot to enjoy along the way.

I read "Never Let Me Go" because I loved Ishiguro's other book "Klara and the Sun." This book was similar in many ways. Both are well-written stories focused on human relationships, set in a world with dystopian elements that the reader slowly discovers over time. "Never Let Me Go" is the story of a friend group, describing the details of their lives as they attend boarding school, graduate, and enter the real world. While I enjoyed discovering the dystopian elements, I was disappointed that the book spent so much time documenting the details of the characters social lives (teasing, gossip, love triangles, etc). I get it, it emphasizes their humanity (important to the plot), but I would have rather spent that time wrestling with bigger topics. Even the book's revealed mysteries felt somewhat underwhelming, being not as ambitious as my own theories. All that said, the book was so well-written, that it held my interest throughout. I understand why the book is highly-rated, even if it didn't meet the expectations I had going into it.

This book follows a week in the life of Jack Bolling, a 30 year old veteran and financial advisor who lives in 1950s New Orleans. The story essentially just narrates Jack's inner thoughts as he goes about his mundane life, working, visiting the beach, going to movies, and conversing with his upper-class family. He's generally aimless and he has organized much of his life around avoiding "the Malaise," an depressive funk that lies ready to ruin his mood. By the time the book was three-quarters done, I realized that the whole book was going to be like this... trivial conversations with his aunt about how he doesn't like fishing while he thinks about how similar he is to his father. Maybe this is one of those books where the sole aim is to transport you into a certain time and place, or maybe I'm too dense to understand the symbolism. Maybe I *am* Jack and I'm reading the book to escape my own Malaise and it's not working. Either way, I'm giving it 2 out of 5 stars.

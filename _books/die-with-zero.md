This book is about spending money to maximize life experiences. It argues that by saving too much, we postpone living our lives until it's too late. The solution: aim to spend all your money before you die. I wanted to read it to challenge my worldview and it made some interesting points. Many people err on the side of retiring too late, exchanging valuable time for tiny risk reductions. Some things can't be postponed, like experiences with older family members or activities that require you to be healthy. I was also intrigued by the idea that "you retire on your memories," meaning, you'll have a lot of time to think later in life, and good memories will keep you company. But instead of arguing for balance, the author tends to double-down on extreme positions and it weakens the book as a result. At times I caught myself laughing at how ludicrous some of his arguments were. In one case, he gets pedantic to make a point. In another, he tells a happily working friend that he needs to TRY HARDER to spend money (if you don't want to, then do it until you do!). Ultimately, it felt like a devils advocate book: useful for questioning the dominant narrative but following it religiously could screw up your life. The core issue for me is that it all depends on a belief that satisfaction comes from consumption, which I simply don't believe. I'm glad I read [How to Live]({{site.url}}/books/#how-to-live) before this so I could put this advice in it's proper context (one option among many, not better, not worse).

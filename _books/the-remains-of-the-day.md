This book follows the story of Mr. James Stevens, a dignified butler who dedicates his life to his work, managing the household of an influential British nobleman, Lord Darlington. As the story progresses, we see Stevens confronted with nuanced situations, like a connection to one of the housekeepers, and Lord Darlington's growing sympathies to Nazi Germany. How Steven navigates these situations is the crux of the story. Are his actions (or inactions) dignified? Do they produce pride or regret? How often do we pass the moral burden of action for the sake of duty? I found these themes interesting, but they were pretty subtle, and buried in a lot of day-by-day recounting of butler-y activities that were hard for me to get excited about. For this reason, I suspect I would have liked [the movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Remains_of_the_Day_(film)) more.

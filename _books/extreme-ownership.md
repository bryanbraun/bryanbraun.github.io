In this book, two Navy Seals share share experiences from their deployment in Iraq, extract the lessons they learned about leadership, and explore how those lessons can be applied in business and in life. I liked how the book was heavy on stories, both from Iraq and business scenarios they've pulled from their consulting practice. While "Extreme Ownership" was only one of the principles they shared, it was a compelling one and it's message of personal responsibility and empowerment ran throughout the book. I found myself taking notes after every chapter. Overall, it's an incredibly solid book on leadership and I hope to revisit it in the future.

This book tells the story of a man and his son taking a motorcycle trip across the country. As he travels, the author often digresses into deeper topics, including technology, craftsmanship, motivation, philosophy, and metaphysics. The story was compelling and often insightful, though it took some patience to work through some parts. The author had this ability to take a latent feeling (like frustration with technology) and put it into words, making me say "Yes! That's what it is!" I experienced this in his discussion of "gumption traps" (basically, managing your motivation), and also the "lack of care" that we see in the world. I struggled with the discussions on philosophy (a central part of the plot). Overall, the book had a unique vibe and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in the topics described above.

Just Keep Buying is a personal finance book that covers basic topics for anyone trying to improve their financial literacy. It focuses on the fundamentals like earning, spending, saving, investing, and retirement. While the book was well-written, it fell short of my expectations. The title made me curious to learn about the book's "big idea" only to learn that the "buying" concept was only discussed in one chapter. I also felt like the book tried too hard to sound unconventional, while giving fairly standard advice. Still, it would probably be a decent primer on personal finance, for someone new to the topic.

This book is like a collection of modern proverbs, centered loosely around the story of a boy, a mole, a fox, and a horse, journeying across a landscape. The book is just as much art as it is literature, each page being illustrated with a distinctive combination of watercolor and scribbley ink. The illustrations look nice but they also show what's happening on the journey, giving context to the messages. The custom drawn words were a bit difficult to read but it had the effect of slowing me down, making the messages more impactful. Still, it was a quick read and good for all ages. The whole vibe was like "The Little Prince" meets "Frog and Toad are Friends"â€”both classics in their own right. The sheet music on the inside cover was a nice touch too (I played it on the piano and it sounded great). Highly recommended!

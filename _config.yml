# When I first set up my site, I used full URLs as disqus page identifiers, which
# was kind of a mistake:
#
#   What I should have done:
#     this.page.identifier = "/2016/05/14/underdogs"
#
#   What I did:
#     this.page.identifier = "http://www.bryanbraun.com/2016/05/14/underdogs"
#
# The page identifier has to stay the same, or you'll lose your comments, which is
# what happened when I changed my site.url variable from `http://` to `https://`
# (to include images appropriately inside https pages). It looks like it's possible
# to update page identifiers but it's through an API and looks like a process.
# Here's some details if I want to try it in the future:
# https://disqus.com/home/channel/discussdisqus/discussion/channel-discussdisqus/migration_new_identifiers_same_urls/
#
# In the mean time, I maintain the older form of the site url as `disqus_url`, which has
# no purpose but to provide consistent page identifiers so comments can be preserved.

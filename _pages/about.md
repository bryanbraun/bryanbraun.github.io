I'm a web developer and designer, currently based in the American Midwest. I use design and code to inspire, educate, and empower humans.

My work has been [featured](/news.md) in The Washington Post, Daring Fireball, Smashing Magazine, and the Discovery Channel.

I'm constantly learning and sharing what I learn through [writing](/archives), [speaking](/speaking.md), and [open-source](https://github.com/bryanbraun). I'm always working on some sort of [side-project](/projects). This is what I'm working on [now](/now).

[These are my principles](/principles.md).

I'm a husband and father. I'm [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [LDS](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng). When I'm not writing code or tweaking fonts, you can find me [reading](/books), riding my bicycle, practicing the piano, or building lego worlds with my kids.

If I don't already know you, you should [email me](mailto:bbraun7@gmail.com) and introduce yourself. We can be friends. It'll be great.

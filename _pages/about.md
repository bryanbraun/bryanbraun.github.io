I'm a frontend developer, currently based in the American Midwest. I use design and code to inspire, educate, and empower people.

I've spent the last 10 years building web products for startups, Fortune 500 companies, Stanford University, The White House, and other great organizations. My open-source code has been used by [thousands](https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xNDk5MDEzMw%3D%3D), including Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. My work has been [featured](/news) in Lifehacker, Smashing Magazine, Morning Brew, and the Discovery Channel.

I like to share what I'm learning through [writing](/blog), [speaking](/speaking), and [open-source](https://github.com/bryanbraun). I'm an [indie hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com/start), and I'm always working on some sort of [side-project](/projects). [This is what I'm working on now](/now).

[These are my principles](/principles).

I'm a husband and father. I'm [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [LDS](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng). When I'm not writing code or tweaking fonts, you can find me [reading](/books), riding my bicycle, practicing the piano, or building lego worlds with my kids.

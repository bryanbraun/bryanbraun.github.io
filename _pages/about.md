I'm a web developer, currently based in the American Midwest. I use design and code to inspire, educate, and empower people.

I've built web products for Fortune 500 companies, Stanford University, The White House, and other great organizations. My open-source code has been used by [thousands](https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xNDk5MDEzMw%3D%3D), including Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. My work has been [featured](/news) in Lifehacker, Daring Fireball, Smashing Magazine, and the Discovery Channel.

I like to share what I'm learning through [writing](/blog), [speaking](/speaking), and [open-source](https://github.com/bryanbraun). I'm an [indie hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com/start), and I'm always working on some sort of [side-project](/projects). [This is what I'm working on now](/now).

[These are my principles](/principles).

I'm a husband and father. I'm [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [LDS](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng). When I'm not writing code or tweaking fonts, you can find me [reading](/books), riding my bicycle, practicing the piano, or building lego worlds with my kids.

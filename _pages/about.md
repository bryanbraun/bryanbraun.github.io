I'm a frontend/fullstack engineer, currently based in the American Midwest. I use design and code to help people.

I've spent the last 12 years building web products for startups, Fortune 500 companies, Stanford University, The White House, and other great organizations.

I'm always working on some sort of [side-project](/projects). My work has been [featured](/featured) in Morning Brew, Smashing Magazine, and Lifehacker. [This is what I'm working on now](/now).

I like to share what I'm learning through [writing](/blog), [speaking](/speaking), and [open-source](https://github.com/bryanbraun).

[These are the principles](/principles) that help me make decisions.

I'm a husband and father. I'm [INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality) and [LDS](https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng). When I'm not writing code or tweaking fonts, you can find me [listening to audiobooks](/books), practicing the piano, or building lego worlds with my kids.

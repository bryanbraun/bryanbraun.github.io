These are the principles that help me make decisions.

1. **People are more important than things** - I care about people and I invest in good relationships. It's a small world, so I treat everyone as if I'll be around them for years to come. Family comes first.
2. **[Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiazen)** - Kaizen is a Japanese word that describes the concept of continual improvement. I seek continual improvement. I am a student of life and I embrace a [growth mindset]({{site.url}}/2011/07/18/the-growth-mindset 'The Growth Mindset').
3. **Seek out critical moments** - [Critical moments]({{site.url}}/2011/02/27/fear-and-the-critical-moment 'Fear and the Critical Moment') are when you face your fears and engage with something difficult, uncomfortable, or unfamiliar. I choose to leave my comfort zone, which enriches my life and increases my capacities. I [push](http://sivers.org/comfort 'Push, push, push.') myself.
4. **Be curious** - I want to know how everything works. I follow my curiosity by keeping an open mind and asking lots of questions. I like meeting new people because everyone, regardless of background, has something they can teach me. I'm [always reading a good book]({{site.url}}/books/). Whenever possible, I [learn by doing]({{site.url}}/2013/08/06/learn-by-doing).
5. **Think long-term** - Life is a marathon, not a sprint. I'm willing to endure temporary pain for long-term benefit. When making decisions, I ask myself, "[Is this an investment?]({{site.url}}/2013/06/27/is-this-an-investment/)" If the answer is *yes*, I don't think twice.
6. **Consume less. Create More** - My best days are the ones when I create. It can be designing, writing, coding... anything! Creating things brings me joy and helps me meet interesting people. The world is full of spectators... I don't need to be one.
7. **[Never settle for being mediocre]({{site.url}}/2012/03/19/never-settle-being-mediocre)** - In doing great work, the little things matter. I seek to go that extra 5% that others are unwilling to go. I practice deliberately. I follow our family motto: "Braun's Keep Trying". I know that good is the enemy of great.
8. **[Focus]({{site.url}}/2013/04/27/focus/)** - It's better for me to do one thing well then a dozen things poorly. I think hard about the things I want to focus on and then I [commit]({{site.url}}/2012/05/13/commitments) myself fully. I strive for [deep work](/books/#deep-work), and I [block out distractions]({{site.url}}/2016/01/04/the-news-wasteland) in order to achieve it. [My attention is precious]({{site.url}}/2018/04/13/jonathon-harris-on-attention/).
9. **Live with integrity** - Character matters. I do what's right, even if it's unpopular and even if nobody sees it. I am honest and transparent. I earn trust by following through with my commitments. Success without integrity is failure.
10. **Serve others** - I believe that service is the rent we pay for living in this world of ours. I design my life such that it's filled with opportunities to serve. I [go to the funeral](https://www.npr.org/2005/08/08/4785079/always-go-to-the-funeral). I [help someone move]({{site.url}}/2013/07/30/help-someone-move/). I give back, and I feel happy when others succeed.

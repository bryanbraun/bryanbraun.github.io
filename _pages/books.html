<p>Whenever I read a book, I add it to the list below, give it a rating, and write up a brief synopsis describing the book and the insights it brought me. Is there a book you think I'll like? <a href="/contact">Let me know</a> and maybe it will show up here soon.</p>
<p><small>Inspired by the <a href="https://sivers.org/book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Derek Sivers booklist.</a></small></p>

  <p>Hey, I'm Bryan. ðŸ‘‹</p>

  <p>I'm a Senior Software Engineer, and I've spent the last 12 years building web products for Lululemon, Warby Parker, Stanford University, The White House, and other great organizations.</p>

  <p>I have full-stack experience, but the thing I'm best at is building and maintaining modern web frontends. Most recently, I've been working with Typescript, React, and Node.js, but I've used many other technologies (looking at you, Rails) and I'm down to learn some new ones.</p>
</div>

I'm currently available for new opportunities.

Specifically, I'm interested in:

  * A senior or lead engineering role (with coding responsibilities)
  * A full-time position
  * Remote (or hybrid, if in Southwest Ohio)

What I can offer you:

* **Experience:** I've been in the arena. I've learned which problems you can punt on and which ones need immediate action. I've got the instincts to identify and mitigate risks before it's too late.
* **Creativity:** I love to explore what's possible and push the boundaries on the frontend, both technically and from a UX perspective (fun example: [Checkboxland]({{site.url}}/2021/09/21/i-keep-making-things-out-of-checkboxes/)). Working at the intersection of design and development is my favorite.
* **A team culture boost**: When I join a team, I bring a dose of optimism and curiosity. My vibe is thoughtful, humble and friendly. I'm famous for my [positive code reviews](https://sparkbox.com/foundry/stop_giving_depressing_code_reviews).
* **Front-end leadership:** I've [written for CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/designing-a-javascript-plugin-system/), [spoken](/speaking) at Fluent Conference, and built popular open source libraries (my projects have been used by Microsoft, Google, and [thousands of other organizations](https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS0xNDk5MDEzMw%3D%3D)). I lead by example and enjoy sharing what I've learned.

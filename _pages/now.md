I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's the sun in shining and the birds are chirping.

## At Work

I've been working remotely as a Software Engineer at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/) for almost two years. Formidable was [recently acquired by NearForm](https://formidable.com/blog/2023/formidable-joins-forces-with-nearform/) but my day-to-day work has been relatively unaffected. Lately, I've been working on an e-commerce codebase migration. I've done a lot of e-commerce work in the last few years and I can feel the momentum of that experience helping me today.

## At Home

I'm up early these days, teaching a morning class twice a week and taking my son to school. I'm also weightlifting twice a week. I've just reached a new bench press max of 220 lbs and my long-term goal is to bench 225. I'm not in a hurry.

I practice the piano a lot these days because I play in church on Sundays. I'm getting better at taking difficult songs, writing in the fingering, and working them up to a playable state.

I've been easing back into side projects and blogging. I recently launched [Let's Get Creative](https://www.bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative/), a fun little site that showcases my favorite online creativity tools. It took a surprising amount of effort for a single-page content site (I ended up using some vacation days to get it out the door). It was a good opportunity to exercise my design skills and I'm really happy with how it turned out.

I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. The weather is getting colder every day.

## At Work

I'm working part-time at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), building web applications. I do little bit of everything but recently I've spent a lot of time working in PHP and Javascript.

The rest of my time is spent working on [Gridmaster](https://gridmaster.io), which is [an Excel addin for learning Excel](https://gridmaster.io/). It's a real, income-producing business and I'm trying to figure out how to grow it. Right now I'm focusing my efforts on marketing.

## At Home

I commute 14 miles each day by bicycle, and I recently started listening to audiobooks during my ride. I'm trying some biographies right now, which is kind of new for me.

I'm serving as an Assistant Scoutmaster and I work with the 12-13 year old boys at church. Sundays I spend all day with my family.

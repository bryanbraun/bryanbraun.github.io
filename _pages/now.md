I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's raining a lot but the weather is getting warmer every day. üå¶Ô∏è

## At Work

After three years at [Nearform](https://nearform.com/), I'm now looking for new work opportunities. If you'd like to work with me, you can [learn more here](/work-with-me).

I've been playing around a bit with AI models, building this [demo RAG application](https://github.com/bryanbraun/rag-demo) as a learning exercise. Yes there's a lot of hype around AI but there's also real use-cases and I'd love to add those tools to my software development toolbox.

## At Home

I'm been making some progress in weightlifting, recently achieving a new max bench press at 240lbs. I didn't ever think I would come this far but I continue to enjoy doing it, so I continue to visit the gym twice a week.

For the last year or so, I've been getting up at 5:50 every morning to teach a before-school class for local teenagers, about faith and life-skills. It's a lot of effort but the good days make it totally worth it.

I had some decent productivity in 2024 ([see here for the list of things I made](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2025/01/01/made-in-2024/)). The project I've enjoyed the most recently is [musicbox.fun](https://musicbox.fun), because it sits at the intersection of a lot of my interests. I'm still working out my goals for 2025.

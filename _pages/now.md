I'm at home in Dayton Ohio, where we've been having a snowy winter.

## At Work

I'm working remotely as a Senior Software Engineer at [Nearform](https://nearform.com/) (Formidable [was acquired by NearForm over a year ago](https://formidable.com/blog/2023/formidable-joins-forces-with-nearform/)). I've been at the company for three years now (which is the second-longest tenure of all the places I've worked). We recently did a company offsite and it was nice meeting my coworkers in person for the first time. I'm continuing to work on codebase modernization for a well-known e-commerce brand.

## At Home

I cut my hair short after growing it out for 2 years. I had never grown it out before and I wanted to try it to see what it would look like. I documented the process and learned a lot but it feels good to be back to my classic look.

I'm been making some progress in weightlifting, recently achieving a new max bench press at 235lbs. I didn't ever think I would come this far but I continue to enjoy doing it, so I continue to visit the gym twice a week.

For the last year or so, I've been getting up at 5:50 every morning to teach a before-school class for local teenagers, about faith and life-skills. It's a lot of effort but the good days make it totally worth it.

I had some decent productivity in 2024 ([see here for the list of things I made](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2025/01/01/made-in-2024/)). The project I've enjoyed the most recently is [musicbox.fun](https://musicbox.fun), because it sits at the intersection of a lot of my interests. I'm still working out my goals for 2025.

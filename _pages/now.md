I'm hunkered down at home in Dayton Ohio. We're vaccinated, but we'll probably continue to play it safe until the kids are too.

## At Work

I've just passed 6 years working at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), building web applications. Our office recently transitioned to 100% remote (even post-pandemic), so I'm working from home for the forseeable future. I'm currently working on [a high-profile e-commerce project](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ashleyszwec_so-proud-of-my-team-for-delivering-the-front-end-activity-6808777034286927872-r61b) using ReactJS and Typescript.

Whenever I get a spare evening, I usually spend it working on [musicboxfun.com](https://musicboxfun.com), an online tool you can use to make songs for a [DIY music box](https://musicboxfun.com/guides/diy-music-box).

## At Home

I'm spending a lot of time at home these days and it suits me. I'm more involved with the kids learning and it's fun coming up with [lunch lessons](https://www.instagram.com/lunchlesson/) and seeing [daily demos](/2019/07/16/daily-demos-a-ritual-for-raising-kids-that-create/). Saturdays I do a lot of reluctant home maintenance. Sundays I spend all day with my family.

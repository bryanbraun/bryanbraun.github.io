I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. All of the kids are in school and things are a bit quieter at home. A possum has started hanging around our house in the evenings, along with the bunnies, bees, and mosquitos we often see at this time of year.

## At Work

I've been working remotely as a Software Engineer at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/) for over a year and a half. Most recently, I've been bouncing between backend and frontend, making improvements to a GraphQL API and building out ApplePay integrations. I've done a lot of e-commerce work in the last few years and I can feel the momentum of that experience helping me today.

## At Home

I've been getting more into health and fitness recently. I recently finished a 6-month calorie-tracking experiment where I ended up accidentally losing 16 pounds. It was the lowest I've weighed since high-school, which was a bit extreme. I've since stopped tracking calories and I intend to gain about half of that weight back. Regardless, I learned a lot and I hope to keep several of [the habits I picked up](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2023/08/22/good-eating-habits/).

In August, I finally [reached my goal of bench-pressing 200 lbs](https://www.bryanbraun.com/2023/08/26/200-lbs/). It became increasingly challenging to make progress near the end, so it was exhilarating to finally get it. I plan to continue weightlifting but I may switch up the exercising I want to focus on.

I've been easing back into side projects and blogging. I have [a new side-project](https://github.com/bryanbraun/lets-get-creative) that I'm excited about. Progress is consistent but slow, due to house-projects and early mornings taking my son to school. That's ok. Family comes first!

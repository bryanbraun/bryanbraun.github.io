I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's cloudy and cold but it's warm inside. It also smells nice (we're on a scented candle kick).

## At Work

After nearly 7 years of building web applications at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), I've accepted a new (remote) position at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/). For the last few months I've been building out a GraphQL API using Apollo and Node. It's been interesting working on backend code after several years of doing frontend. There's always something new to learn.

## At Home

I've been getting more into health and fitness recently. In February I started listening to [the Huberman Lab podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/), measuring body fat, tracking calories, eating more protein, and weight-lifting twice a week. I've never really focused on this kind of stuff in the past so it's taught me a lot about food and exercise. Over the past year my bench press max has increased from 140 to 185 lbs. It feels pretty good to be "the strongest I've ever been." üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My side-projects (and blogging) have been on the back-burner recently as I've focused more of my attention on my family and relationships. I hope to ease back into writing and coding projects this year but I'll probably be taking it slow at first. Family comes first!

I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. The days are warm and the evenings bring out the fireflies. Even after nine years is Ohio, it still feels magical.

## At Work

I've been working remotely as a Software Engineer at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/) for over two years now. Formidable was [recently acquired by NearForm](https://formidable.com/blog/2023/formidable-joins-forces-with-nearform/) but my day-to-day work has been relatively unaffected. Lately, I've been working on an e-commerce codebase migration. I've done a lot of e-commerce work in the last few years and I can feel the momentum of that experience helping me today.

## At Home

I've gotten into weightlifting for the past couple of years and I finally reached my goal of bench-pressing 225 lbs. It's been a rewarding journey and I'm not sure what fitness goal I want to pursue next. Let me know if you have suggestions!

I practice the piano a lot these days because I play in church on Sundays. I'm getting better at taking difficult songs, writing in the fingering, and working them up to a playable state.

I've been easing back into side projects and blogging. I've been spending most of my coding time on [musicbox.fun](https://musicbox.fun) these days, mostly because it sits at the intersection of a lot of my interests and I get to flex my frontend muscles.

I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. The weather is (slowly) getting warmer.

In 2022, I'm working on cultivating optimism and enthusiasm. The world has been a sea of pessimism and fear over the past two years and I'm tired of it. Instead, I'm deciding to be the change I want to see. Ask me what changes I'm making. Even better, join me. Maybe it'll catch on.

## At Work

After nearly 7 years of building web applications at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), I've accepted a new (remote) position at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/). Sparkbox was a magical place and [I will miss it a lot](https://twitter.com/BryanEBraun/status/1489741479249682432). My new role should provide many opportunities for me to learn and grow and I'm looking forward to that.

## At Home

Working remotely means I'm spending a lot of time at home these days. I'm more involved with the kids learning and it's been fun coming up with [lunch lessons](https://www.instagram.com/lunchlesson/) and seeing [daily demos](/2019/07/16/daily-demos-a-ritual-for-raising-kids-that-create/). I've recently started getting together with some friends to play games in the evening and that's been really fun. Saturdays I do a lot of reluctant home maintenance. Sundays I spend all day with my family.

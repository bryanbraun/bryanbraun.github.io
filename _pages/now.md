I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. The weather is warm, the flowers have bloomed, and I'm spending more time outdoors (mostly walking, biking, and doing yard work).

## At Work

I'm over a year into my remote Software Engineering position at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/). I feel very fortunate to be here a time when the industry has been contracting a bit. For the last few months I've been building out a GraphQL API using Apollo and Node. It's been interesting working on backend code after several years of doing frontend. There's always something new to learn.

## At Home

I've been getting more into health and fitness recently. In February I started listening to [the Huberman Lab podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/), measuring body fat, tracking calories, eating more protein, and weight-lifting twice a week. I've never really focused on this kind of stuff in the past so it's taught me a lot about food and exercise. Over the past year, my bench press max has increased from 140 to 195 lbs (I have a goal to bench 200). It feels pretty good to be "the strongest I've ever been." üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I've been easing back into side projects and blogging. I recently gave a talk at Dayton Web Developers about augmented programming using AI tools ([recording here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDyBR4XkC5A), [slides here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JbBrACpAlFWew3nNQ4C0VET6v1Ow1TDS4TQt_lV125E/edit#slide=id.g4dfce81f19_0_45)). I have more things I want to do but I'll probably be taking it slow. Family comes first!

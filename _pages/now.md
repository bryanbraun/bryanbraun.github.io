I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's chilly outside and the daylight hours are waning. We've pulled out our cold-weather gear and switched our thermostat from A/C to heating. I think we're all set to spend another winter in Dayton.

## At Work

I've been working remotely as a Software Engineer at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/) for over a year and a half. Formidable was [recently acquired by NearForm](https://formidable.com/blog/2023/formidable-joins-forces-with-nearform/) but my day-to-day work has been relatively unaffected. Lately, I've been bouncing between backend and frontend, making improvements to a GraphQL API and building out ApplePay integrations. I've done a lot of e-commerce work in the last few years and I can feel the momentum of that experience helping me today.

## At Home

I'm up early these days, teaching a morning class twice a week and taking my son to school. I'm also weightlifting twice a week. I've been able to repeat [my recent bench press max of 200lbs]({{site.url}}/2023/08/22/good-eating-habits) and I'm hoping to bench 205 next (I tried for it once but didn't get it). I'm not in a hurry.

I practice the piano a lot these days because I play in church on Sundays. I'm getting better at taking difficult songs, writing in the fingering, and working them up to a playable state.

I've been easing back into side projects and blogging. I recently launched [Let's Get Creative](https://www.bryanbraun.com/lets-get-creative/), a fun little site that showcases my favorite online creativity tools. It took a surprising amount of effort for a single-page content site (I ended up using some vacation days to get it out the door). It was a good opportunity to exercise my design skills and I'm really happy with how it turned out.

I've worked on a few other small things like updating some older posts and adding JSON feeds for [my book reviews]({{site.url}}/books.json) and [this now page]({{site.url}}/now.json). Feel free to subscribe, if you want to get future updates in your feed reader.

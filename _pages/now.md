I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. It's cloudy and cold but it's warm inside. It also smells nice (we're on a scented candle kick).

## At Work

After nearly 7 years of building web applications at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), I've accepted a new (remote) position at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/). For the last few months I've been building out a GraphQL API using Apollo and Node. It's been interesting working on backend code after several years of doing frontend. There's always something new to learn.

## At Home

I've started up a twice-a-week weightlifting routine with a couple of friends. My bench press max has increased from 140 to 185 lbs and it feels pretty good to be "the strongest I've ever been." üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

My side-projects (and blogging) has been on the back-burner recently as I've focused more of my attention on my family and relationships. I hope to ease back into writing and coding projects in 2023 but I'll probably be taking it slow at first. Family comes first!

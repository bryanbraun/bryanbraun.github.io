I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. The kids are back in school and summer is coming to a close.

## At Work

After nearly 7 years of building web applications at [Sparkbox](https://seesparkbox.com/), I've accepted a new (remote) position at [Formidable](https://formidable.com/). For the last few months I've been building out an ecommerce frontend using React, Nextjs, and Typescript.

## At Home

I've started up a weekly weightlifting routine with a couple of friends. My bench press max has increased from 140 to 175 lbs and it feels pretty good to be "the strongest I've ever been." My side-projects have been on the back-burner recently, but I've started attending local meetups again and it feels good to be back.

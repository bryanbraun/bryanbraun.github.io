I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. Everything's green, summer is here, and I'm trying to get outside as much as I can.

## At Work

Things are in transition. More to come soon.

I continue to tinker with AI as a development tool. Sometimes it's incredibly helpfulâ€”other times, not so much. I find it most helpful for brainstorming ideas and tutoring me on technical topics that I'm less familiar with.

## At Home

I've continued to lift weights, recently hitting a new max bench press of 240lbs. Weightlifting has been fun but I really enjoyed going on a long run recently, so I'm considering doing more of that going forward. We'll see.

My early morning class is on hiatus for the summer, so I'm hoping to have a bit more time for sleep and writing/coding. I finally added MIDI import/export to [musicbox.fun](https://musicbox.fun) which felt pretty good (I've wanted to add it for a long time). There's a lot more I'd like to add but I may have to turn my attention to some major house projects for a bit. ðŸ˜©

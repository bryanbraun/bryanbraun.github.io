I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. We're back in the school routine, and I'm busier than ever.

## At Work

I've just finished onboarding as a full-stack engineer at ClassDojo. I've been wanting to work in edtech for a long time and I'm excited to be working on a product that my family actively uses (we use Dojo Islands for play, Dojo Tutor for tutoring, and ClassDojo for communication with my daughter's 3rd grade teacher).

I continue to experiment with AI as a development tool, especially at work. I've been pretty surprised at how much better it's gotten. I use it pretty much every day, especially for writing tests, fleshing out storybook files, and building non-trivial sql queries.

## At Home

I've continued to lift weights, recently hitting a new max bench press of 245lbs. Weightlifting has been fun but I really enjoyed going on a long run recently, so I'm considering doing more of that going forward. We'll see.

I'm up every morning at 5:45 to teach my early morning youth class. It's a challenge, and my sleep has suffered a bit, but it's also rewarding at times. I'm still trying to get my rhythm, and hopefully it will improve with time.

I'm at home in Dayton Ohio. Everything's green, summer is here, and I'm trying to get outside as much as I can.

## At Work

I've just started a new role as a full-stack engineer at ClassDojo. I've been wanting to work in edtech for a long time and I'm excited to be working on a product that my family actively uses.

I continue to tinker with AI as a development tool. Sometimes it's incredibly helpfulâ€”other times, not so much. I find it most helpful for brainstorming ideas and tutoring me on technical topics that I'm less familiar with.

## At Home

I've continued to lift weights, recently hitting a new max bench press of 240lbs. Weightlifting has been fun but I really enjoyed going on a long run recently, so I'm considering doing more of that going forward. We'll see.

My early morning class is on hiatus for the summer and my extra time is all being funneled to some long-neglected house projects. So far I've done the toilet valve, bathroom fan, attic floor, painted door/trim, and concrete patch. I still need to fix some drywall and the tree/fence situation. I don't really enjoy this stuff but I enjoy it more than living in a house that's falling apart. Hopefully I'll be able to get back to MusicBoxFun and other coding projects soon.

These are my 10 principles. They help me make decisions.

1.  **People are more important than things** - I care about people and I invest in good relationships. It's a small world, so I treat everyone as if I'll be around them for years to come. Family comes first.
2.  **[Kaizen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiazen) **- Kaizen is a Japanese word that describes the concept of continual improvement. I seek continual improvement. I am a student of life and I embrace a [growth mindset](http://bryanbraun.com/2011/07/18/the-growth-mindset "The Growth Mindset").
3.  **Seek out critical moments** - A [critical moment](http://bryanbraun.com/2011/02/27/fear-and-the-critical-moment "Fear and the Critical Moment") is when a person does something unfamilar, uncomfortable, or fear invoking. I choose to leave my comfort zone, which enriches my life and increases my capacities. I [push](http://sivers.org/comfort "Push, push, push.") myself.
4.  **Go big** - I am [bold](http://bryanbraun.com/2012/02/26/be-bold "Be Bold"). I'm not afraid to stand out and take a risk. I take action without waiting to be anointed.
5.  **Pay it forward** - I recognize where I have been blessed and I return those same opportunities to those who come after me. I seek to serve people. I want to help others succeed.
6.  **[Surround yourself](http://bryanbraun.com/2011/04/18/location-location-location "Putting yourself in the right spot") with greatness** - I associate with amazing people. Maybe, over time, their greatness will rub off on me.
7.  **Ask for help** - I am willing to admit that I don't know everything. [I ask for help](http://bryanbraun.com/2011/08/28/just-ask "Just Ask") because I learn fastest by leveraging other people's knowledge and experience. I'm willing to listen to other people, no matter their lifestyle, history, position, or prominence. In doing so, I hope to become more teachable and learn faster.
8.  **[Never settle for being mediocre](http://bryanbraun.com/2012/03/19/never-settle-being-mediocre)** - In doing great work, the little things matter. I seek to go that extra 5% that others are unwilling to go. I practice deliberately. I keep trying things, and if it doesn't work, I try something else. I know that good is the enemy of great.
9. **[Focus](/2013/04/27/focus/)** - It's better for me to do one thing well then a dozen things poorly. I think hard about the things I want to focus on and then I [commit](http://www.bryanbraun.com/2012/05/13/commitments) myself fully. I strive for [deep work](/books/#deep-work), and I [block out distractions](http://www.bryanbraun.com/2016/01/04/the-news-wasteland) in order to achieve it.
10.  **Never compromise your values** - If I give you my word, then I will deliver. Period.
